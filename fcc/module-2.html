            <p>Welcome to Module 2.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In this module,&nbsp;you’ll learn:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why emails are different from every other form of copy (and how that affects your strategy)</li>
                <li>How to pack your email copy with valuable content readers love</li>
                <li>The one question you should ask yourself when you sit down to write</li>
                <li>How to write great emails for any situation (including multi-email sequences)</li>
                <li>How to come up with awesome&nbsp;ideas "on demand" (even if you can’t think of any or don’t feel "creative")</li>
                <li>How to write emails that sell, without being sleazy or salesy</li>
                <li>How you can use stories to surprise, entertain, and convert readers (even if you’re not a "natural storyteller," or think you don’t have any stories to tell)</li>
                <li>The exact process I use to write amazing subject lines every time&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There’s not a client on earth who doesn’t need email copywriting.&nbsp; Even if a client is already doing email marketing, they can always use more emails … and more copywriters who are great at writing them.</p>
            <p>Sadly, many freelance copywriters are missing the boat on this one.</p>
            <p>They don’t feel confident about their email copywriting skills, and may even be confused about what makes email copy great in the first place. &nbsp;</p>

            </figure>
            <p>I get it -- email copywriting can be confusing.</p>
            <p>An email selling iPhone skins is going to sound very different from one promoting a new blog post from an industry thought leader…and so on.</p>
            <p>But here’s the great news: Though all of these emails seem different on the surface, the best copywriters are able to&nbsp;systematically &nbsp; turn out great email copy, each and every time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In this module, I’ll pull back the veil and show you the specific techniques I’ve been using to do it for years.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
            <h3><strong>No one wants to read an email</strong></h3>
            <p>Let’s get this out of the way right now: The era of the exciting AOL "You’ve got mail!" message came to an end DECADES ago.</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-171139.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-171139.png">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <figcaption>
                    Can you believe they actually made a movie about this s***?
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>These days, there’s not a living soul that doesn’t consider it a dull chore to slog through an inbox of emails.</p>
            <p>Email isn’t like a landing page or other types of copywriting. <em>It’s&nbsp;invasive.</em> <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p>Readers don’t seek it out, it just appears in their inbox the way an unwelcome houseguest shows up unannounced at your doorstep.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If your email copy is pushy, boring, irrelevant, generic, or fluffy, it’s going to end up in the trash.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On the other hand, we’ve all been on the receiving end of emails we can’t wait to open.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Instead of sucking up our energy and draining our attention, they offer us value. Sometimes they even entertain us, at least for a moment or two.</p>
            <p>I’m not talking about the type of questionable "value" people get from freebies, giveaways, or discounts.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Those are easy to offer -- anyone can type "Free coaching" or "90% off" into a subject line and press&nbsp; <em>Send</em> . &nbsp;</p>
            <p>But have you ever noticed how difficult it is to actually get you interested in an offer like that? Why else would we all have so many unopened emails like this piled up in our "promotions" folders all the time?</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-171228.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-171228.png">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <figcaption>
                    " <strong>Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh</strong> !"
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Instead, I’ll show you how to craft emails that have REAL VALUE, and get results like these:</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-171256.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-171256.png">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <figcaption>
                    <strong>These open rates are way above industry averages</strong>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Achieving this takes effort, but it’s not as daunting or out of reach as you might think. &nbsp; If you follow the guidelines in this module, you’ll be able to write emails your clients love, with complete confidence.</p>
            <h3><strong>"When in doubt, help them out"</strong></h3>
            <div>When copywriters ask me about email copywriting, they often say things like:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I don’t know what to write about"</li>
                    <li>"How can I sell without being pushy?"</li>
                    <li>"How do I come up with stories?"</li>
                </ul>

            <p>These are the wrong questions.</p>
            <p>Can you guess why? Think about it for a moment before moving on.</p>
            <p>The answer is that they’re all about YOU. They’re not focused on the most important person…the person you’re writing to.</p>
            <p>Things instantly become clearer when you focus on the reader instead. Help them out!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A better approach is to ask:&nbsp; <strong>"What does the reader need to accomplish, and how can I help them do it?"</strong></p>
            <p>You can use this attitude as a compass to guide you through every piece of email copy you write. It works because it’s all about making the reader’s life better. This automatically makes you a welcome guest in their inbox.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Let’s go through a real life example so you can see exactly how this unfolds when you’re working with clients.</p>
            <p>We’ll start with a thought experiment: Imagine I asked you to write an email selling labor law posters to small businesses who are legally required to purchase updated posters every year, like this one:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/labor-law-poster.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/labor-law-poster.png"></p>
            <p>If you had no other information, you might think:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What should I write about?"</li>
                <li>"Which features and benefits of the product should I highlight?"</li>
                <li>"Should I use fear tactics to get them to buy right away?"</li>
                <li>"Should I figure out what the common objections are, and try to overcome them?"</li>
                <li>"Should I research competitors’ prices and show them why this is a good deal?"</li>
                <li>"Should I start with a story? I heard that stories are great to use in emails"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>NO, NO, NO.</p>
            <p>All you have to do is a simple role reversal. Ask yourself, what does the person reading the email NEED? What’s the BEST way to help them get it?</p>
            <p>Switching over to this mentality may take some practice. But once you get used to it, &nbsp; <strong>you’ll be able to answer all of the above questions with shocking speed and accuracy</strong> <strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>Check out what I wrote for one of my clients in the exact situation I’ve described. As you read through it, see if you can figure out WHY I made the decisions I made (we’ll do a thorough analysis afterward, but in the meantime, no peeking)…</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-182151.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-182151.png"></p>
            <p>Now this is a very simple email, and it didn’t take me long to write it. But everything in it is carefully designed to cater to the specific person receiving the email: A small business owner who may need a new labor law poster.</p>
            <p>Let’s do a complete analysis so you can see my thought process going in:</p>
            <h4>1. Selling a product is not my only goal.</h4>
            <p>This is very counterintuitive, but it works. I’m first and foremost helping the business owner stay compliant with the law and avoid fines.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It’s not that my goal isn’t to sell. It is! But giving value is an equal&nbsp;priority. I’m a helpful advisor as much as I am a&nbsp;copywriter and salesperson.&nbsp;</p>

            <h4>2. Understand what they need.</h4>
            <p>No one really cares about labor law posters. Yes, it’s something that’s important to the reader’s business, but as far as they’re concerned it’s a TINY detail of their overall operation.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you were a small business owner, would you have the time or energy to concern yourself with the finer details of different labor law poster packages, compliance laws, or whether or not you could save $5 by price shopping on Amazon? Of course not! You’re busy running your business.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You’d just want to know WHEN your current poster expires, and HOW to get a new one as quickly and easily as possible.&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>3. Help them get what they want.</h4>
            <p>Notice how I immediately focus in on what’s important to them, making everything extremely clear and fluid so they barely even need to think. All the information they need is right here in this email.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I even taught them how to check if they need new labor law posters &nbsp;in <strong>30 seconds</strong> , and added 2 call to action buttons to make their lives easier and save them time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And I made sure to mention that the all-in-one poster we were selling was EVERYTHING they needed to stay compliant and avoid fines. This is very important because it prevents them from procrastinating -- they know they can just click, and be done with it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>This email improved my client’s conversions by more than 300% over the previous version they were using.</strong></p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-173913.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-173913.png"> Will this exact same strategy work for every email you write? Of course not. As we discussed earlier, all emails are different.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And, as you’ll recall from Module 1, there’s no one "correct" way to write any piece of copy. I could have written the above email in any number of different ways. But the process of getting into the reader’s head and figuring out how to get them&nbsp;to take action is non-negotiable.</p>
            <p>That’s why it’s always critical to do a role reversal and ask yourself -- <strong>&nbsp;what does this person need, and how can I help them get it?</strong> &nbsp; When you do that, your copy will naturally move in the right direction.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center">Chameleon copywriting: How to adjust&nbsp;your approach for any&nbsp;situation</h3>
            <p>Remember, you need to adjust your strategy to fit the particular situation of each email you write. Sometimes, the differences between these situations can be subtle.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Let’s look at another email I wrote, also for small business owners -- except this time, the circumstances were slightly different, calling for radically different email copy.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In this case, the business owner signed up to receive a report called "7 Hiring Mistakes Most Bosses Make–and How to Avoid Them".</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-173841.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-173841.png"></p>
            <p>Since this email also went out to small business owners, you may be wondering why it’s so much longer than the previous one. Great question!</p>
            <p>There are a few reasons why I chose to write it this way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hiring employees is an expensive, emotional, and risky&nbsp;decision for business owners, creating a great opportunity for me to offer valuable, helpful content to the reader.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The benefits of a labor law poster ("avoid fines" and "stay compliant") are more obvious than the benefits of the system we’re offering in this email -- so a&nbsp;bit more "selling" makes sense.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>In this case, the reader specifically requested INFORMATION about how to hire employees&nbsp;(they signed up to receive a free report). Whereas in the first email, we can assume readers don’t want to LEARN about labor law posters -- they just want the fastest, easiest path to staying compliant and avoiding fines.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is why it’s so important to cultivate your Detective Mindset and focus on accomplishing your email copywriting goals in a systematic way, rather than using a rigid set of rules.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Think of the end result you’re looking for, gather every clue you can find, and work backwards to help the reader take the action that will help them.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>How to&nbsp;warm readers up before the sale</strong></h3>
            <p>Whenever possible, you want to delay your sales pitch to readers for at least the first couple of emails.</p>
            <p>Think of a rock concert or stand up comedy show.&nbsp; Whether it’s Metallica playing at Madison Square Garden, or Louis CK at The Beacon Theater, they all have one thing in common: They never go right up on stage.&nbsp; They always warm the audience up with an opening act before the main attraction.</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/metallica.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/metallica.png">

                    Creative Commons image via &nbsp; <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m-a-r-k/5358372861/">Mark Wainwright</a>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Email copywriting works the same way. You’ll usually do better by warming readers up first.&nbsp;The more expensive the product (or service), the more important this strategy becomes.</p>
            <p>That’s why marketing emails are sometimes referred to as&nbsp;lead nurturing, follow up, or <em>autoresponder</em> &nbsp; emails.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Regardless of what you (or the client) call it, it simply means that you send valuable information with no strings attached -- at least for the first 2-3 emails.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This helps you gain trust, build goodwill, and makes it more likely readers will open your emails. If you do it right, they may even anxiously look forward to hearing from you when you’re finally ready to sell them something.</p>
            <p>Check out this lead nurturing email I wrote for one of my clients, a car dealer, to send to customers who’d requested a price quote from the dealership’s website:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-172400.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-172400.png"></p>
            <p>Notice how this email teaches the reader something that’s relevant, useful, and surprising -- with zero selling.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Contrast that with the&nbsp;typical pushy email you’d expect to receive from a car dealer, like this one:</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-172128.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-172128.png"><br>
                <figcaption>
                    A typical car dealer email -- UGH.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>…and you can see why it stands out, gets attention, and builds trust.</p>
            <p>Once you do this, it becomes much easier to transition into selling later on.</p>
            <p>Check out this snippet from my well known "Top 5 Upwork Hacks" email series, where I transition from a valuable tip, to selling (in email #3):</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-172457.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-172457.png"></p>
            <p>In fact, every&nbsp;email in the original series contained valuable information -- even the sales emails.</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-172742.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-172742.png"></p>
            <p>Notice how simple it was -- yet it was also incredibly effective.&nbsp;Far from distracting readers from the sale, teaching something surprising and helpful makes sales emails even more powerful.</p>
            <p>Naturally, this is also the&nbsp;default approach I use when writing email sequences for clients. They love it, because it offers their readers tons of value, and -- when done right -- leads to even more conversions.</p>

            <h4 style="text-align:center"><strong>"But Danny, how do&nbsp;I come up with ideas for email copy?"</strong></h4>
            <p>One of the hallmarks of great freelance copywriters is that they’re always able to come up with ideas for fresh email copy -- seemingly on demand.</p>
            <p>Many copywriters struggle with this, but there’s no need to make it overly complicated.</p>
            <p>Watch the video below to see how I come up with great ideas for email copy -- in any situation.</p>
            <video controls="controls" height="auto" width="100%">

            <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
            </video>
            <p>To show you how valuable clients can be in helping you come up with ideas, here’s an example of a very effective email one of my clients sent out to his prospects (camp owners who’ve expressed interest in updating their websites):</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/camp-owners-email-with-commentary.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/camp-owners-email-with-commentary.png"></p>
            <p>Remember, clients are full of great insights like these, but it’s up to you to ask the right questions in order to uncover it.</p>
            <h3>How to use stories to surprise and entertain readers (even if you’re not a "natural storyteller")</h3>
            <p>Let me ask you an honest question: Do the words "new blog post" get you visibly excited?</p>
            <p>I didn’t think so.</p>
            <p>Yet one of my most popular emails of all time was an announcement for a new blog post I’d written. It got an open and click rate that destroyed&nbsp;industry averages.</p>
            <p>My secret? I didn’t start off talking about the blog post. Instead, I hooked readers with a story:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-184213.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-184213.png"></p>
            <p>I use stories every chance I get, whether I’m selling or teaching -- and whether it’s an FTW email, or something I’m writing for a client.</p>
            <p>People love stories because they’re one of the oldest forms of human communication and connection.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We’ve been telling stories for tens of thousands of years. It’s literally in our DNA, which is why even simple stories have the potential to captivate us.</p>
            <p>Used properly, a good story can act like a trojan horse, delivering your client’s message without&nbsp;feeling like a sleazy marketing email.</p>
            <h4>"But Danny, what if I don’t have any stories to tell?"</h4>
            <p>A few years ago, I had no captivating stories to tell. At least, that’s what I told myself at the time.</p>
            <p>Today, I have a file that contains DOZENS upon dozens of interesting writing prompts at any given time.</p>
            <p>What changed?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Did I suddenly become a VIP or socialite who rubs shoulders with celebrities and elite business people and politicians? Hmm, let me think ab-- no.</p>
            <p>The only thing that changed is psychological. Once I realized that even the simplest stories make for amazing emails, I’m constantly on the lookout for even the smallest nuggets that can turn an ordinary email from&nbsp;okay… to GREAT.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of writing great email copy, a story can be ANYTHING surprising (preferably with some educational or practical value). Even a small factoid can work wonders.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You don’t even need to come up with it on your own! Some of the best performing emails I’ve written use stories I found online, in books, or even in movies.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For example, this story appeared in my Facebook news feed one morning, and I wrote it down knowing I’d eventually use it in an email:</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-185129.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-185129.png">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <figcaption>
                    I got this entire story from an article I read online
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Practically the entire email is comprised of that one story, and I didn’t come up with so much as one single detail on my own.</p>
            <p>Great stories are all around you. You just need to switch from&nbsp;passive consumer &nbsp; to&nbsp;active listener.</p>
            <p>Whenever I come across (or think of) anything surprising or interesting, I immediately write a note about it into a file called "writing prompts".</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of 100% non-original "stories" that are sitting in my Writing Prompts file:&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poker champion Phil Ivey once said he doesn’t sit at the poker table with a pre-determined strategy. Instead, his actions depend on what the other players do. (I learned this from a TV show about poker.)</li>
                    <li>Great pickpockets usually have an accomplice who warns people that there’s a pickpocketer on site and urges them to check to make sure their wallets are safe. When people feel for their wallets, the real pickpocketer knows which pocket they keep it in. (I saw this in a TED talk online.)</li>
                    <li>A guy paid the DMV using 300,000 pennies, just to make a point. (I saw this story on Twitter.)</li>
                    <li>Most people have no clue that the famous novelist Stephen King used to be a high school teacher and live in a trailer. Or that his first bestseller,&nbsp;Carrie , came close to ending up in the trash. (I read about these nuggets in Stephen King’s book, &nbsp;On Writing. )</li>
                    <li>Chris Rock’s performance at Madison Square Garden on New Year’s Eve seems like second nature, but what you didn’t see was how he painstakingly tested and refined his jokes behind the scenes for twelve straight months beforehand. (I read about this in a magazine.)</li>
</ul>
            <p>You can use these if you want to. I don’t care… I’m constantly adding new ones. Remember, they’re literally everywhere so there’s never a shortage of good ones.</p>
            <p>Now let’s talk about how I use these prompts to come up with great email copy clients love.</p>
            <h3><strong>Email alchemy: Turning interesting nuggets into pure copywriting gold&nbsp;</strong></h3>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages of starting with cool stories is that it doesn’t take much effort to transform them into great copy.</p>
            <p>It’s like oatmeal -- a bit of brown sugar and maple syrup&nbsp;are easy additions that make it taste great.</p>
            <p>The trick is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make sure you connect the story to the email copy you’re writing.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you need to throw in a "twist" in order to make it fit. My friend Chris Davis, a great email copywriter, calls this approach "Turning the Corner".</p>
            <p>Here’s an example of how I start with an interesting nugget from my writing prompts file, then&nbsp;turn the corner &nbsp; to connect it to the copy I’m writing:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-185330.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-185330.png"> You can also spice things up a bit more, if you want to.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the following example , I decided to use a story about the movie star Sylvester Stallone to reveal misconceptions about success. I could have just come right out and told the story, but I decided to tease people first by opening with a fun word association game:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-185459.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-185459.png"></p>
            <p>It’s OK to play around like this, as long as you make sure each line will invoke enough surprise and curiosity to draw the reader in. In this case, I knew people wouldn’t be able to resist the game, making this a powerful, curiosity driven opening.</p>
            <p>You can even use stories to jazz up emails in "boring" industries. Here’s an example from an email that one FTW student wrote for her client, a B2B company:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-185410.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-185410.png"></p>
            <p>I love this! Here’s a freelancer&nbsp;writing about a dreary technical topic, so she infuses the copy with something weird and interesting to draw readers’ interest. Well done.</p>
            <p>In case you’re wondering where she came up with the interesting tidbit about poker… She learned it from my Secrets Of A Six-Figure Upworker course! Remember, there are interesting nuggets EVERYWHERE -- it’s just a matter of making it a habit to notice them and write them down.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(Btw, it’s also worth noting that she knew absolutely nothing about "HHCAHPS surveys" before working with this client. Remember, great copywriters are detectives…they make it their business to learn about their clients industries.)</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center">Topping your copy off with an amazing subject line</h3>
            <p>Once you’ve written your email copy, it’s time to pair it with an irresistible subject line.</p>
            <p>Check out the video below to see my exact process for coming up with subjects that make readers want to open -- consistently and predictably.</p>
            
            <video controls="controls" height="auto" width="100%">
            <source src="NBImages/FCCvideos/FCC-M2-2---subject-line.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
            <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
            </video>
            <p>Here’s a real example of&nbsp;how I used this exact process to come up with one of my best performing subject lines ever:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-173528.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-173528.png"></p>
            <p>Notice how a few of them are terrible…most are OK…and a few are excellent. The idea is to end up with a few great choices clients will love.</p>
            <p>One final note on subject lines: Make sure to keep them as short as possible, especially since most people are checking email on their phone. The last thing you want is to write a great subject line that gets cut off by a mobile screen.</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-173723.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-173723.png"></p>

            <p>Feeling stuck on an email, or just unsure of what to write next?</p>
            <p>Here are a few of my favorite "ingredients" you can use to get over the hump. Just go through this list, pick the one you think would fit best, and bam -- you’re back in business.</p>
            <p><strong>Create urgency.</strong> It’s never a bad idea to give readers extra motivation to act. Urgency, or any other type of scarcity are great ways to do that. Is a sale ending soon? Will prices be going up? Are there a limited number of products, free consults, or webinar seats? All of these are great examples of how to use strategic urgency to enhance your email copy.</p>
            <p>You can also get creative! For example, I once paid $1,500 for one of James Altucher’s evergreen products after reading his email saying the "price would probably go up soon."</p>
            <p><strong>Write a bulleted list.</strong> You could write bullets about a lead magnet, a product or service, a list of features and benefits, a webinar, or anything else. I even use bullet points to "sell" readers on clicking through to a blog post or other article. One of my clients used to say that "great copywriters think in bullet points" -- a lesson that has stuck with me ever since.</p>
            <p><strong>Tell a success story.</strong> I always like to ask clients if they have any stories or case studies about people they’ve helped through their business. These can be great material for your email copy. You can tell the long version, the short version, or even include multiple stories in one email.</p>
            <p>If the client doesn’t have any success stories to share, you can even tell someone else’s success story, as long as it’s relevant. You obviously don’t want to misrepresent it as one of your client’s success stories, but it’s OK to use other people’s stories to make a point as long as you’re clear that they’re not a customer of your client.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ.</strong> A list of frequently asked questions and answers about a product or service is an excellent go-to piece of any autoresponder sequence. You can combine it with any of the other approaches in this course, or even just use it on its own.</p>
            <p>The client may have a FAQ list already, so be sure to ask. If they don’t, be prepared to help them come up with one (remember to charge them for your time if you do this).</p>
            <p><strong>Testimonials.</strong> These are similar to success stories, but more succinct. Many clients will tend to have some testimonials on hand, even if they don’t have case studies, so these are a great backup. Adding one or more testimonials can also a great way to spice up any email.</p>
            <p><strong>Describe a product or service.</strong> As obvious as this sounds, I can’t tell you how often an email series fails to actually discuss the product or service being offered. Email readers aren’t mind readers, so if you’re writing copy for something that needs to be described, don’t forget to do it.</p>
            <p><strong>A helpful insight or story.</strong> Remember to keep a running list of these on your own as "writing prompts." You’ll find tons of them in your everyday life and reading list, once you start looking.</p>
            <p>It can be something as simple as "Coffee used to be considered unhealthy, but now everyone says it’s healthy! It just goes to show you that conventional wisdom is often totally backwards..."</p>
            <p>Or, "Did you see this article about the guy who brought $300,000 in PENNIES to the DMV? Some people will do anything to get a point across…"</p>
            <p><strong>A link to the product or service you’re offering.</strong> Most emails include one at the bottom, but there’s no rule that says you can’t have multiple. In fact, placing 2 or more links throughout your email copy can often improve the click through rate, so feel free to try it out.</p>
            <p><strong>Explain how something works.</strong> Unless something is blatantly obvious it’s hard to go wrong by including at least a brief explanation of it. This can be as straightforward as bulleting out a simple 3 step process (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3) to really spell it out for your readers -- while also making the copy feel more valuable.</p>
            <p><strong>Links to helpful articles.</strong> Linking out to content from high quality sources (especially big sites) is a great way to give extra value, improve your own credibility, and make your copy more powerful.</p>
            <p><strong>A useful fact, statistic or quote.</strong> Whatever you’re writing about, there’s a good chance you can find a useful stat, quote, or factoid to back it up. If you feel like your copy can use one, just Google it and see what comes up.</p>
            <p><strong>Credibility markers.</strong> If your client has a well known customer or partner company, pointing that out can be a great way to boost their credibility with readers. Or if they’ve ever been featured on a popular site or podcast, mentioning that (and maybe even linking to it) can achieve a similar effect.</p>
            <p><strong>Create a positive association.</strong> Talking about something that makes people feel good -- even if seems totally unrelated to your client -- can be a great way to create a positive association in readers’ minds.</p>
            <p>For example, you might relay a story about Steve Jobs to make a point about business, mention a surprising fact about Disney World, or talk about a beautiful Caribbean Island.</p>
            <p><strong>Pose a socratic question.</strong> Asking a question can be a powerful tactic because it transforms the reader from passive consumer of your copy, to active participant. Even a question as simple as "Would it be worth 2 minutes to find out if you could save $2,000 or more?" immediately activates the reader’s imagination and makes them feel involved in the conversation.</p>
            <p><strong>Describe their problem in detail.</strong> Readers love it when you understand the exact problem they’re trying to solve. The better you can explain it, the more understood they feel, and the more likely they are to take the action you want them to take.</p>
            <p>This works best when you use the same words they use to describe the problem, so be sure to ask the client for some good intel. I always like to ask clients, <em>"How would the reader describe the problem to her husband?"</em> If the client doesn’t know, that’s a good sign that you should be interviewing their readers or customers.</p>
            <p><strong>A "PS" section at the end of the email.</strong> You can fill it with any of the above ideas or something totally different -- your choice.</p>

<h4>[Top 5 Upwork Hacks] Hack #1</h4>
<p><br /> <code><strong>body:</strong></code></p>
<p>Hi <strong>NAME</strong>,</p>
<p>Do you want to be able to charge higher rates on Upwork – and actually get them?</p>
<p>Maybe even break into the exclusive and mysterious realm of premium pricing? (Actually if you stick with me for a while, you’ll see it isn’t all that mysterious.)</p>
<p>I hope you said yes. Because, A) it shows me you’re sane, and B)  this hack is designed to help you do that.</p>
<p>I’ll give you the skinny on how it works with a funny little story...in a minute.</p>
<p>First, here’s a quick preview of what you can expect from me in the coming days.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next week or so, I’m going to ship you my favorite hacks for making money on Upwork.</p>
<p>Some of these I figured out through trial and error, others came from flashes of insight, and some of it was just instinct.</p>
<p>Either way, the point is to help you accelerate your journey to earning the kind of money freelancers deserve for all the hard work we do.</p>
<p>I’ve chosen these 5 hacks carefully, because <strong>they’re simple, easy to implement, and can help you earn more money right away.</strong></p>
<p>Could be that not all of them will apply to you -- that’s okay... Even successfully executing 1 or 2 of them can have a serious impact on your bottom line.</p>
<p><strong>(Example: as you’ll see, one of these hacks earned me over $30k, and literally anyone can do it.)</strong></p>
<p>For now, without further ado, let’s get right down to Hack #1.</p>
<p>I’m going to tell you about the hack itself, as well as the psychology behind it, so you can see how it really works.</p>
<p>Now, back to that funny story that explains it...</p>
<p>Just a smidge under 3 years ago, I was finishing up a project for one of my clients, when suddenly, my human nature kicked in.</p>
<p>(No, I don’t mean that I needed a bathroom break. Where is your mind at?)</p>
<p>What I mean is that I didn’t want to just earn a full time living on Upwork, I wanted to do better than that.</p>
<p>Clearly I needed to raise my rates in order to accomplish that. But by how much?</p>
<p>Well, I’d heard there were plenty of "off-line copywriters" who could charge way more than us "lowly online freelancers"...</p>
<p>So I did some research to see what these big dogs were hauling in.</p>
<p>Turns out many of them were charging $1,000 for a single page of web copy.</p>
<p>That’s when my pesky human nature perked up even louder than before.</p>
<p>I tried to bat it down with the "reality cry" of conventional Upwork wisdom...the first commandment of which is "Thou shalt not charge as much as offline freelancers!"</p>
<p>But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get that ($1k) number out of my head.</p>
<p>What if I could actually pull it off?</p>
<p>If it worked, I could make significantly more money, without putting in so much as an ounce more effort. When I thought of it in those terms, that damn human nature of mine started firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p>Finally, I couldn’t resist the urge any longer.</p>
<p>What could I possibly lose by trying? (Little did I know the answer was actually "a lot," as you’ll see in a few segundos.)</p>
<p>So I decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>I rolled up my sleeves, and carefully started writing proposals for 1 page of web copy, just like the big boys. My price tag? A cool $1k.</p>
<p>Waiting for the responses wasn’t easy. Like watching a pot of water try to boil. I wanted to jump out a window.</p>
<p>But just when I thought I was about to go barking mad...one by one, they started trickling in, like little rain droplets landing softly on a beautiful lily pad. (&lt;---Can you believe a professional copywriter wrote this? If I can make money on Upwork, chances are you can too.)</p>
<p>And then, I really wanted to jump out the damn window............</p>
<p>The messages from the potential clients all read more or less the same:</p>
<p><em>"Nice samples, but your price is too high."</em></p>
<p><em>"Your work looks good, but too much moolah."</em></p>
<p><em>"I’d like to hire you, but why you charge so dang much??"</em></p>
<p>Ad. Freakin’. Nauseam.</p>
<p>Every time I saw one come in, I felt like that queen from Hamlet -- they were like "daggers that pierced mine eyes." (Yes I know it was "ears" in Hamlet, not eyes. But that wouldn’t even make a lick of sense here.)</p>
<p>My natural human drive to excel was quickly replaced with depression and a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p>
<p>Defeatist thoughts washed over me...</p>
<p><em>What made me think I could get away with charging so much? Maybe I should respond to some of these messages with a lower offer, if I want to work this week. Wait, no, they’ll sense desperation and grind me down to nothing!</em></p>
<p>Catch 22’s all over the place.</p>
<p>I even thought about throwing in the towel on Upwork altogether.</p>
<p>My experiment had crashed and burned, and it seemed like the prevailing wisdom about not being able to charge "real world" prices on Upwork was dead on after all.</p>
<p>Worse yet, everyone had known it. Except me. My greed had clouded my judgment and turned me into one arrogant SOB.</p>
<p>What was I thinking?</p>
<p>I was about to close my laptop and go for a walk to clear my head when another message popped up on the screen. There was this split second glimmer of hope inside me...but then I realized it was just more of the same...</p>
<p><em>"Impressive work, Danny. But your quote is too high. Sorry."</em></p>
<p>It was the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>
<p>As if failing to increase my income wasn’t bad enough, I had actually lost money by putzing around asking for higher prices.</p>
<p>I felt like toppling my desk over.</p>
<p>But then, I couldn’t help but notice...</p>
<p>There was something strange about that last rejection message.</p>
<p>About all of them, actually.</p>
<p>Can you spot it? Look closely...</p>
<p>These rejections had been mixed in with compliments. Weird, no?</p>
<p>These people clearly admired my work enough to write me back and tell me.</p>
<p>I’d struck a chord with them.</p>
<p>And yet, not a one would even consider paying a somewhat premium price to work with me?</p>
<p>I started to wonder if maybe there was something else going on here. Something I was missing.</p>
<p>Only one way to find out...</p>
<p>I reached for my laptop and pounded out the following message back to that last client: <em>"What makes you say my quote is too high?"</em></p>
<p>A few minutes later, he shoots back the following: <em>"Actually, it’s because of your hourly rate. Your profile says you charge $75/hr, which means that at $1k, you’d basically be billing me for over 13 hours of work. Do you really think it’ll take you that long to write one page of copy??"</em></p>
<p>It took me a minute to wrap my brain around what was happening here.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at the total price I was quoting, this client -- and the others -- seemed to be "anchored" to the hourly rate they saw in my profile.</p>
<p>(By the way, "anchoring" is a real psychological effect. If you Google it you’ll see that this scenario is a very typical example of how it shapes our judgment.)</p>
<p>In other words, these clients didn’t view the $1k price tag as one-thousand dollars. They saw it as paying for 13+ hours of copywriting.</p>
<p>And that seemed like too long to take writing "just one page."</p>
<p>For a moment I considered removing my hourly rate from my profile entirely. If there was no hourly fee for clients to mentally anchor to, then it couldn’t work against me.</p>
<p>But then I thought about it some more, and started to wonder  if I could actually make the anchoring effect work in my favor instead.</p>
<p>So I tried an experiment. I went to my profile, clicked the edit</p>
<p>button, and raised my hourly rate to...$125.00.</p>
<p>Then I took a deep breath, and applied to more 1-page copywriting jobs.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>Within a few days, I’d won my first one, with zero price objections.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before I’d won another, and another.</p>
<p>Not only that, but I was predictably able to raise all my flat fees across the board...for email copy, landing pages, video scripts, you name it.</p>
<p>Clients were now mentally anchored to the higher figure of $125.</p>
<p>And 8 hours seemed much more reasonable to them than 13.</p>
<p>And of course they liked my work, so they were okay with paying more than my competitors charged...as long as they could make the math "make sense" in their heads.</p>
<p><strong>Notice that absolutely nothing about the project changed.</strong></p>
<p>My quote, the amount of work involved, the competitors’ prices all stayed exactly the same from the first (disastrous) scenario to the second (winning) one.</p>
<p>The only thing that changed was the way the clients perceived my fee, based on how many hours they thought that fee represented.</p>
<p><strong>So there are a couple of bottom lines with this hack.</strong></p>
<p>The first is that you need to make sure that your "hourly rate" in your profile isn’t too small in relation to the size of the flat fees that you are quoting to clients.</p>
<p>Otherwise, they will get anchored to that number and they’ll feel like they aren’t getting a good deal.</p>
<p>The second is that if you want to charge more than other Upworkers, you can absolutely do that.</p>
<p><strong>The conventional wisdom that says you can’t charge above average or premium prices on Upwork is totally wrong.</strong></p>
<p>You just need to make sure to do it in the right way. And that is, if you’re going to charge higher flat fees than the pack, you need to go ahead and make sure that the hourly rate in your profile is higher too.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure how high to make it, then just keep moving it up a bit at a time until you encounter some resistance. But in general you shouldn’t be too afraid of this -- as long as you’re charging based on the value you truly provide.</p>
<p><strong>Is this ethical? Absolutely...</strong></p>
<p>Flat fees and hourly rates have little to do with each other. When you’re quoting a flat fee, you can (and should) quote higher than you would if you were making a strict "hours for dollars" calculation.</p>
<p>So this is all 1000% kosher in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>Btw, this doesn’t only work for flat fee projects. It also works when you bid on hourly projects as well.</p>
<p>If you bid $50/hr on a job when your profile says your hourly rate is $30, then it’s not going to appear as "sensible" to the client as it would if your profile said your hourly rate was $50.</p>
<p><strong>There are many ways you can use this deeply psychological hack on Upwork. Can you think of any others?</strong></p>
<p>Hit ‘reply’ and give me your best guess. (Don’t worry about being wrong, I don’t judge.)</p>
<p>Can’t think of a guess? No worries. Just reply and say hi and introduce yourself. I personally read every email.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<h4>[Top 5 Upwork Hacks] Hack #2</h4>
<p> </p>
<p><code><strong>BODY:</strong></code></p>
<p>Hi <strong>NAME</strong>,</p>
<p>I want to tell you about an Upwork hack that has literally earned me tens of thousands of dollars over the course of a couple of years (and I’ll show you proof in this email)...just from doing one simple thing.</p>
<p>And yet this hack goes unnoticed by the overwhelming majority of online freelancers.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’ve been around Upwork for a while, and haven’t noticed it, you shouldn’t beat yourself up at all. It may be simple, but it’s still elusive, and even many 10 year freelance veterans don’t catch it.</p>
<p><strong>Which means that I’ve earned $30,000+ so far that most of them literally never had a shot at, because they didn’t do this one simple thing.</strong></p>
<p>Can you guess what it is?</p>
<p>In case you haven’t yet, I’m talking about working in more than one category.</p>
<p>Let’s get specific.</p>
<p>I’m a copywriter. The main category most (if not all) Upwork copywriters find work in is the Writing category.</p>
<p>However, I personally also look for work in the Sales &amp; Marketing category.</p>
<p>To see how well this has paid off for me, check out the screenshot below that shows you how much I’ve earned in just the S&amp;M category over the course of 2 years:</p>
<img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/JW5a84x6SnZ4Wuc6KtR1.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/JW5a84x6SnZ4Wuc6KtR1.png">

<p>I’m not showing you these numbers to brag. Just to drive home the point that working in the Sales &amp; Marketing category (in addition to the Writing category) has paid off for me in a huge way.</p>
<p>Now here’s where things get weird.</p>
<p>The way Upwork’s categories are set up, it seems as though you’d find all your copywriting jobs in the Writing area. I mean that must be where clients go when they want writing, right? Seems perfectly natural. And most copywriters never give this a second thought.</p>
<p>But it turns out that many clients don’t think this way. Because as you’ll see, they’re coming at it from a totally different angle.</p>
<p><strong>Take a look at the Wikipedia definition for "Copywriting":</strong></p>
<p><em>"Copywriting is writing copy for the purpose of advertising or marketing..."</em></p>
<p>This is why many clients go straight to the Marketing category when looking for copywriters. They (correctly) think of copywriting as a marketing activity, so it just seems to them like the right place to look.</p>
<p>When you reframe things from the client’s perspective in this way (which you should allllways be doing, about everything), going to the Sales &amp; Marketing section to get more leads and more jobs becomes a no brainer, right?</p>
<p>As I’ve already alluded to, there is far less competition for copywriters in Marketing, since most copywriters are looking for work only in the Writing category (even most of the ones who have marketing listed as one of their specialties -- this shows you how elusive this hack really is until someone points it out to you).</p>
<p>Are you starting to see why the simple act of working in more than 1 category is such a profitable thing to do?</p>
<p><strong>Just to be uber clear</strong>, I’m not recommending that you ditch the Writing category (or whatever your "main" category happens to be). You’ll definitely want to be in multiple categories. I hope that goes without saying, but I couldn’t take the chance...my goal is to help you do better, not worse. :)</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ve found this lesson helpful. But there’s sort of a bigger picture idea here that I want to bring to light:</p>
<p><strong>Upwork isn’t an easy game. If you’re going to kick ass, you need to put yourself in a position to win.</strong></p>
<p>We’ll come back to this idea later. In the meantime, be on the lookout for the next hack, and we’ll talk more.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<h4>[Top 5 Upwork Hacks] Hack #3 - this one is awkward...</h4>
<p> </p>
<p><code><strong>BODY:</strong></code></p>
<p>Hi <strong>NAME</strong>,</p>
<p>Ready for things to get a tad bit awkward?</p>
<p>I hope so. Because explaining this hack is like breaking the news to your best friend that they have bad breath. Telling them sucks, but as their BFF, it’s your job.</p>
<p>Same thing here. You came to me for the brutal truth about how to win on Upwork. It’s my job to give it to you. Cool?</p>
<p>Okay, now that you get where I’m coming from, let’s get to the brutal part. :)</p>
<p>I’m talking about your Upwork photo.</p>
<p>Now if yours is one of the exceedingly few that doesn’t need work, fine. I’m sorry. Feel free to write me back criticizing me for having too-pale skin or no hair or something like that, okay?</p>
<p>But the truth is that most everyone reading this can make a lot more money just from the simple act of replacing their crappy Upwork photo with one that screams out value, confidence and professionalism.</p>
<p><strong>How much is this hack worth? </strong>Well you may remember that the previous hack helped me earn $30k that most of my competitors weren’t even in the running for. And I have reason to believe that today’s is even more valuable.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick story to illustrate why... Back in 2007, the world famous violinist Joshua Bell walked into a D.C. train station wearing jeans, a t-shirt and a baseball cap, and started to play world class music in exchange for tips from passersby. <strong>He made $32.</strong></p>
<p>Why? The answer is this: <strong>Perceived value.</strong></p>
<p>One of the major factors behind how much people are willing to pay for absolutely anything is visual cues. Even if it isn’t being done consciously, we’re constantly sizing things up by their appearances.</p>
<p><strong>Understand that Bell’s MUSIC didn’t change one bit. It was friggin’ awesome. </strong></p>
<p>But the way people perceived the quality and value of what he was offering had tanked, because he looked like a "regular Joe" in the crowded D.C. Metro.</p>
<p>As a freelancer on Upwork, you don’t want to be "regular Joe," either. First of all, because it makes you look invisible. And secondly, because you want to command <strong>above average</strong> prices for your work.</p>
<p>Do you think clients would flock to my doorstep to pay $125 if I had a photo that was as casual as the ones below?</p>

<img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/OrcCRfbdR3qz4MbkG0hP.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/OrcCRfbdR3qz4MbkG0hP.png">
<p>No offense to any of these people, of course. They are all beautiful and, I’m sure, quite talented.</p>
<p>But just be honest: If you’re a premium client who’s looking to pay out $125 per hour, and all else was equal, wouldn’t you give it to someone who appeared to treat their business more like a... business?</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. It’s nice to show freelancers that being a freelancer is fun and hip and cool. And all that is fine and good...</p>
<p><strong>But when clients hire you, they are thinking about work. Business. It’s fun, but it’s also serious. Especially if you’re asking for a serious amount of money--as you should be. </strong></p>
<p>(To drive this point home further, think of what you’d envision if I victoriously told you that I landed a "serious client" today.)</p>
<p>I’m not saying you need to go crazy with this. Don’t get all Photoshoppy or anything. We’re not trying to look like celebs on the cover of People magazine here.</p>
<p>Just find a friend who is a good amateur photographer with a damn good camera and have them snap some professional shots of you. Bonus points if it’s a nice background.</p>
<p>Like I promised you, these hacks are simple and doable.</p>
<p><strong>One more important thing... </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hacks are sweet, but they can only take you so far.</strong></p>
<p>They’re a great place to start, obviously. And the ones I gave you will raise your income if used properly.</p>
<p>But if you want to consistently earn great money on Upwork, there is just a lot more to it.</p>
<p>That’s one of the reasons why it’s so rewarding...and why I’ve been able to earn 6 figures in just 12 months, without ever looking for work.</p>
<p>Which is exactly why I’ve developed an online course designed with the express goal of helping you win on Upwork.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing: </strong><strong>Secrets of a Six-Figure Upworker</strong></p>
<p>In this premium online course, you’ll learn...</p>
<ul>
<li>How I write proposals that actually work and get clients excited to pay me 2-10x the average bid</li>
<li>How I make my profile truly "sticky" and get invited to private jobs where I have little or no competition</li>
<li>How I get clients to instantly trust me and want to work with me on the spot</li>
<li>The actual steps I take to get repeat business from over 50% of my clients</li>
<li>How to handle yourself when negotiating with clients so that you’re able to maximize your income and charge top dollar</li>
<li>And much more...</li>
</ul>
<p>And, more importantly, you’ll have a framework that lets you put all of this knowledge into action, so you can become one of the 5% of Upworkers who bring home 95% of the cash. No networking meetings, no business card printing, no cold calls/emails, no BS.</p>

<h4>SUBJECT: [Top 5 Upwork Hacks] Hack #4</h4>
<p> </p>
<p><code><strong>BODY:</strong></code></p>
<p>Hi <strong>NAME</strong>,</p>
<p>Today's hack is adding a testimonial to the top of (or near the top of) your Upwork profile.</p>
<p>First I'll explain the deeply psychological reasons that this hack is so powerful. Then I'll tell you my "rules" for how to execute it properly (hint: there's more to it than copying and pasting).</p>
<p>If you've read the book <em>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</em> by Dr. Robert Cialdini, then you know that "social proof" (which is what a testimonial is) is one of 6 key drivers that move us humans to action.</p>
<p>That's some serious awesome sauce right there. But by placing a testimonial right at the top of your profile, you also <strong>take advantage of another potent, scientifically proven psychological weapon:</strong> The power of first impressions.</p>
<p>It turns out that, based on a study done at NYU some years back, <strong>when study participants heard just a few positive sentences about a total stranger, their overall impression of that stranger was more positive as a result.</strong></p>
<p>That means we can actually make potential clients see us more positively too, just by arranging our Upwork profile in a way that immediately shows them positive social proof about us.</p>
<p>In other words, placing at least one testimonial right up top in your profile can really stack the deck in your favor. I've been using this hack for almost 3 years with great results.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some tips on how to do it:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It's best to use testimonials that come directly from your Upwork client reviews, since they'll have the most credibility. (If you don't have any Upwork reviews yet, then just use any testimonials you do have, regardless of where they're from.)</li>
<li>Try to use multiple testimonials, since more social proof is generally better. (This is why toothpaste companies say things like, "4 out of 5 dentists recommend our brand.") But if all you have is 1 or 2, you should still definitely use those.</li>
<li>Ideally, you're looking for testimonials that specifically talk about things your ideal client is looking for. The more specific, the better. For example, let's say you write web content. A testimonial that says you helped your client rank better on Google is going to be much more effective than one that you "did a great job."</li>
<li>Remember to put those suckers right at the top of your profile, to take maximum advantage of social proof and first impressions. Winning on Upwork is all about stacking the deck in your favor.</li>
<li>(One last thing for those of you who are brand new to Upwork: Save this hack for <strong><em>after </em></strong>you set up your initial profile and have it reviewed and approved by Upwork. This makes it easier to get your profile approved.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here's what mine look like:</strong></p>

<img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/mI9OmTywSp0buLPblvZQ.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/mI9OmTywSp0buLPblvZQ.png">

<p><strong>It’s all about stacking the deck in your favor.</strong></p>
<p>Upwork can be incredibly rewarding, or incredibly frustrating. It all depends on us.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever felt like you were playing the lottery when submitting a proposal for a job...</p>
<p>Or you’ve equated Upwork with a "bargain basement" of crappy low paying jobs where you’re constantly undercut by low bidders...</p>
<p>Then chances are you know exactly what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Yet you’ve also probably noticed certain people winning. You may have even had a positive experience here and there, but haven’t quite been able to reliably duplicate it.</p>
<p>That’s because online freelancing isn’t an intuitive game. It’s incredibly difficult to figure it all out from scratch. Most of us need someone to show us the ropes.</p>
<p>This is why so many freelancers just spin their wheels for months and even years, throwing their hat into the ring on job proposal after job proposal, with mediocre results, or worse.</p>
<p><strong>Remember this: the moment you try to win on Upwork by doing what comes naturally, you’ve already lost. </strong></p>
<p>Yet this isn’t what’s happening to the members of my course, <strong>Secrets of a Six-Figure Upworker. </strong></p>
<p>These freelancers are getting empowered with eye-opening strategies, and also helping themselves unlearn most of the conventional wisdom that just doesn’t work worth a damn on sites like Upwork.</p>
<p><strong>Put simply, these people are putting themselves in a position to win. </strong></p>
<p>Check out this testimonial:</p>
<p><em>"Before I met Danny, my earnings would be all over the place from $30 to $60 per hour. I took a big break from bidding on the site, and came back to it after taking his course. And with Danny’s help I landed a $125 per hour gig right out of the gate!" </em></p>
<p><strong>See what other Upworkers are saying here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here’s some of what’s included in the course: </strong></p>
<p>• The exact system I’ve used to earn over 6 figures in 12 months, personally</p>
<p>• Behind the scenes tear downs of real winning proposals</p>
<p>• How to win work whenever you need it, consistently and reliably</p>
<p>• My step by step proven formula for creating a profile that acts as a lead generating machine, attracting clients for you 24/7/365</p>
<p>• How to raise your rates</p>
<p>• My unorthodox proposal writing methods that fly in the face of conventional wisdom (hopefully the naysayers won’t catch on any time soon)</p>
<p>• Advanced negotiating tips to help you command (and get) top dollar from clients</p>
<p>• How to win work quickly in just about any field, even if you have no experience</p>
<p>• Access to my private forum where you can ask questions and get support from other course members (this is a powerful, vibrant community)</p>
<p>• How to get more repeat business and job invites so you can spend more time getting paid, and less time looking for work</p>
<p>• 30 day money back guarantee (zero risk)</p>
<p>• And much more</p>
<p><strong>Read a full description of the course here </strong></p>
<p>This is a great chance for you to become one of the people playing the "invisible game" of online freelancing, rather than just playing "the game."</p>
<p>I guess what it all comes down to is, do you want to be one of the 5% of people who positions themselves to win on Upwork, or are you happy to work hard for average results?</p>

<h4> [Top 5 Upwork Hacks] Hack #5 - I saved the best for last</h4>
<p> </p>
<p><code><strong>BODY:</strong></code></p>
<p>Hi <strong>NAME</strong>,</p>
<p>I saved the best hack for last.</p>
<p>Because not only did this hack change my online freelancing results completely, it makes all the other hacks work better too.</p>
<p>In fact without it, the others won’t work nearly as well. So consider this your reward for sticking through to the end of my Top 5 Hacks series.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Often I’ll hear someone complain that they aren’t doing well on Upwork.</p>
<p>The challenges are always the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not getting any high quality job invites from potential clients (this is a shame because these are pure gold, and one of the reasons I spend almost no time looking for work)</li>
<li>Not winning enough jobs / not winning jobs at high enough prices</li>
</ol>
<p>Like any good doc, the first thing I do is check their "vital signs," i.e. their profile.</p>
<p>And do you know what the first thing I usually see is?</p>
<p>Right below their name, there’s usually a title that says something like...</p>
<p>"High quality writer"</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>"Skilled designer"</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>"Experienced marketing consultant"</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a huge problem with these titles (and any others like them) -- they’re not SPECIFIC. </strong></p>
<p>So I always say the same thing to these freelancers: "How do you expect to get high quality clients to invite you to jobs and/or pay you high prices when they don’t even know WHAT you do?"</p>
<p>Then they usually say something back like, "But it says what I do, right in my profile!"</p>
<p>At that point I need to gently explain to them that clients don’t have time to read everyone’s profile. You need to get their interest <em>before</em> they read your profile, or that sucker’s never going to get read at all.</p>
<p><strong>Think about the way clients shop on Upwork.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say they’re looking for a copywriter to help them increase sales on their website. So they go to the hiring section, click on "Copywriters" and start browsing.</p>
<p>Then they see results that look like this:</p>
<p><strong>John Smith - "Quality copywriter" </strong></p>
<p><strong>Jane Jones - "Copywriting to serve your needs" </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Danny Margulies - "Sales copy that actually sells!"</em></strong></p>
<p>Woah, do you see what happened there?</p>
<p>Do you think the client is automatically going to open up the first three profiles and spend 20 minutes reading through them?</p>
<p>Or do you think they’re going to skim down to the middle of the page until they see a guy who’s specifically talking about sales -- and then click on <em>that</em> profile?</p>
<p>Obviously they’re going to do the latter.</p>
<p>This is one of the key hacks I’ve used over the past few years to get tons of invites to excellent jobs from rockstar clients.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I first realized this, it was a major epiphany for me.</p>
<p>It just suddenly hit me that being "just another copywriter" was making me totally invisible to potential clients when they searched or browsed the listings.</p>
<p>The same is also true when you’re submitting a proposal for a job, whether you were invited or not.</p>
<p>Again, clients <strong>aren’t</strong> automatically going to read your profile. Or your samples. Hell, they aren’t even guaranteed to read your proposal, especially if they’ve received a ton of them (which is often the case).</p>
<p>Having a strong title that they see <strong>right away</strong> gives them a solid first impression of who you are and what you do.</p>
<p>This makes it more likely that they will:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> Invite you to a private job</p>
<p><strong>B)</strong> Read through your proposal and your samples</p>
<p><strong>C)</strong> Like your proposal and your samples (remember what I showed you about first impressions in the last email I sent you?)</p>
<p><strong>D)</strong> Hire you over all the other freelancers who applied (you’ll have a big advantage since most freelancers make the mistake of not being super specific about what they do -- some don’t even really know what they specifically do)</p>
<p><strong>E)</strong> Pay you an above average or even premium price</p>
<p>This is why every single person who’s completed my <strong>Secrets of a Six-Figure Upworker course</strong> has created a title that sticks out in the minds of their potential clients.</p>
<p>The course even contains an entire lesson devoted to choosing the right one, along with other key parts of your profile that most online freelancers ignore to their detriment.</p>
<p><strong>Click here to become one of the 5% of Upworkers who earn 95% of the money </strong></p>
<p>There’s plenty more you’ll learn in the course too, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How you can escape the depressing "feast or famine" cycle that keeps most freelancers constantly looking for their next gig (I did this through a combination of lots of repeat business and high quality job invites, which you’ll learn more about in the course)</li>
<li>The exact steps I used to build a six-figure freelancing business in less than 2 years, despite starting with absolutely no formal experience or training (even my first full time year brought in $65k)</li>
<li>How you can use your profile and proposals to set the stage to charge clients much higher than average prices</li>
<li>The unorthodox proposal writing methods I use to not only get clients to respond to me, but get them fired up to talk to me (including real examples)</li>
<li>The fast track approach that helped me win more jobs in my first week on Upwork, than most "experienced" Upworkers win in an entire month</li>
<li>How to negotiate above average or premium fees with power and confidence</li>
<li>Behind the scenes looks at real proposals that get clients excited and help me command high fees</li>
<li>How to 10x your income from a single client</li>
<li>And much, much more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The course often pays for itself in 1-2 jobs.</strong> There’s a 30 day money back guarantee, so feel free to test drive it at zero risk.</p>
<p>Even if you aren’t interested in making six figures, or commanding premium fees -- imagine how much better it’d be to even earn a few extra thousand dollars in the next 6-12 months.</p>
<p>Thanks again for being a part of my Top 5 Hacks series. I hope you’ve found it helpful and useful.</p>

            <p>Here is an actual email series that one FTW student used to 5X conversions for her client.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Notice how she takes a "boring," technical industry that she initially knew nothing about, and managed to quickly get up to speed by wearing her Detective Hat. Then, she created this short but effective email series using strategies and tactics from Module 2.</p>

            <p>Struggling to get your HHCAHPS surveys back on time?</p>
            <p>How HHCAHPS surveys affect your 5-star rating (and your bottom line)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Email Body:</strong></p>
            <p>Hi NAME,</p>
            <p>It’s hard to know where to start with all the different quality measures you now have to keep track of for Value Based Purchasing.</p>
            <p>And every year, all of these tiny little metrics will be added up to give you a quality score. Based on the score, your "quality-adjusted" payment rate can really help or hurt your bottom line.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But you already provide your patients with the best quality of care -- so you’re good right?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There’s one thing that trips up even the best home health agencies though.</p>
            <p>The HHCAHPS surveys.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Did you know that you need at least 40 completed surveys to even receive a rating? One less, and your results aren’t considered statistically significant.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But that’s simple enough right? Just get 40 surveys and you’re good to go.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Here’s the issue: How do you get your patients to return the darn thing?</p>
            <p>You might provide your patients with the best quality of treatment possible, but still end up losing out to the organizations that have implemented strategies for getting their surveys back.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>If you’re struggling to get your HHCAHPS surveys back, you’re not alone.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>That’s why I asked [PRESENTER NAME], the senior clinical consultant at [COMPANY NAME], to lead our next webinar as part of our Outcome Improvements series. It’s literally called "How do I get them to send back those surveys?"</p>
            <p>We’ve dedicated a full hour to sharing actionable steps that you can use to make sure your patients return those HHCAHPS surveys.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Here are just a few of the things we plan to cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The surprising impact of HHCAHPS on the VBP and 5 star ratings</li>
                <li>Prioritizing your outcomes for improvement</li>
                <li>How your survey return rate can affect your agency’s rating</li>
                <li>Actionable steps you can take <strong>immediately</strong> to increase the return rates of your HHCAHPS surveys&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>How professional poker can increase your survey return rates</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Email Body:</strong></p>
            <p>Hi NAME,</p>
            <p>In our last email, we talked about how your HHCAHPS survey return rate can have a huge impact on your agency’s bottom line.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But it can often feel like you have almost no control over this part of your rating…you can’t choose the questions that go in the survey, change the wording, or even send them out yourself!</p>
            <p><strong>How can you improve something with so many restrictions in the way?</strong></p>
            <p>To answer this question, let’s turn to professional poker. Yes, the card game.</p>
            <p>In poker, there’s a concept known as "small edges." These are small, recurring advantages that can pay out big over time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The thing is, they’re almost invisible to amateur players who think that the point of poker is to just bet, raise, and fold. But professional players will seek out small edges in every hand.</p>
            <p>By gaining even a 1% advantage and compounding it over time, the professionals come out on top every time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The same principles apply when trying to boost your survey return rate. <strong>There are so many simple techniques you can use to gain an edge over your competition.</strong></p>
            <p>For example, did you know that you can customize surveys with your own branding?</p>
            <p>It’s such a simple thing to add, but many agencies completely overlook it. All you need to do is contact your survey administration vendor and ask to have you logo added to both the cover letter and the survey.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This one quick change makes it easier to patients to identify the source of the letter or email – making it much less likely that they’ll throw it in the trash with all their credit card offers and campaign flyers.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>In our next webinar, we’ll cover many more of these "small edges" and give you an actionable plan for increasing your survey return rates.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p class="ql-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><strong>How do I get them to send back those surveys?</strong></p>

            <p>Get ready for a value packed, no nonsense session that’ll give you a leg up over your competition, boost your survey return rates – and ultimately, add to your bottom line.</p>
