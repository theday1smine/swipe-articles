            <p>Welcome to Module 2.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In this module,&nbsp;you’ll learn:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why emails are different from every other form of copy (and how that affects your strategy)</li>
                <li>How to pack your email copy with valuable content readers love</li>
                <li>The one question you should ask yourself when you sit down to write</li>
                <li>How to write great emails for any situation (including multi-email sequences)</li>
                <li>How to come up with awesome&nbsp;ideas "on demand" (even if you can’t think of any or don’t feel "creative")</li>
                <li>How to write emails that sell, without being sleazy or salesy</li>
                <li>How you can use stories to surprise, entertain, and convert readers (even if you’re not a "natural storyteller," or think you don’t have any stories to tell)</li>
                <li>The exact process I use to write amazing subject lines every time&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There’s not a client on earth who doesn’t need email copywriting.&nbsp; Even if a client is already doing email marketing, they can always use more emails … and more copywriters who are great at writing them.</p>
            <p>Sadly, many freelance copywriters are missing the boat on this one.</p>
            <p>They don’t feel confident about their email copywriting skills, and may even be confused about what makes email copy great in the first place. &nbsp;</p>

            </figure>
            <p>I get it -- email copywriting can be confusing.</p>
            <p>An email selling iPhone skins is going to sound very different from one promoting a new blog post from an industry thought leader…and so on.</p>
            <p>But here’s the great news: Though all of these emails seem different on the surface, the best copywriters are able to&nbsp;systematically &nbsp; turn out great email copy, each and every time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In this module, I’ll pull back the veil and show you the specific techniques I’ve been using to do it for years.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
            <h3><strong>No one wants to read an email</strong></h3>
            <p>Let’s get this out of the way right now: The era of the exciting AOL "You’ve got mail!" message came to an end DECADES ago.</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-171139.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-171139.png">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <figcaption>
                    Can you believe they actually made a movie about this s***?
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>These days, there’s not a living soul that doesn’t consider it a dull chore to slog through an inbox of emails.</p>
            <p>Email isn’t like a landing page or other types of copywriting. <em>It’s&nbsp;invasive.</em> <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p>Readers don’t seek it out, it just appears in their inbox the way an unwelcome houseguest shows up unannounced at your doorstep.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If your email copy is pushy, boring, irrelevant, generic, or fluffy, it’s going to end up in the trash.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On the other hand, we’ve all been on the receiving end of emails we can’t wait to open.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Instead of sucking up our energy and draining our attention, they offer us value. Sometimes they even entertain us, at least for a moment or two.</p>
            <p>I’m not talking about the type of questionable "value" people get from freebies, giveaways, or discounts.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Those are easy to offer -- anyone can type "Free coaching" or "90% off" into a subject line and press&nbsp; <em>Send</em> . &nbsp;</p>
            <p>But have you ever noticed how difficult it is to actually get you interested in an offer like that? Why else would we all have so many unopened emails like this piled up in our "promotions" folders all the time?</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-171228.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-171228.png">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <figcaption>
                    " <strong>Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh</strong> !"
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Instead, I’ll show you how to craft emails that have REAL VALUE, and get results like these:</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-171256.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-171256.png">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <figcaption>
                    <strong>These open rates are way above industry averages</strong>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Achieving this takes effort, but it’s not as daunting or out of reach as you might think. &nbsp; If you follow the guidelines in this module, you’ll be able to write emails your clients love, with complete confidence.</p>
            <h3><strong>"When in doubt, help them out"</strong></h3>
            <div>When copywriters ask me about email copywriting, they often say things like:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I don’t know what to write about"</li>
                    <li>"How can I sell without being pushy?"</li>
                    <li>"How do I come up with stories?"</li>
                </ul>

            <p>These are the wrong questions.</p>
            <p>Can you guess why? Think about it for a moment before moving on.</p>
            <p>The answer is that they’re all about YOU. They’re not focused on the most important person…the person you’re writing to.</p>
            <p>Things instantly become clearer when you focus on the reader instead. Help them out!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A better approach is to ask:&nbsp; <strong>"What does the reader need to accomplish, and how can I help them do it?"</strong></p>
            <p>You can use this attitude as a compass to guide you through every piece of email copy you write. It works because it’s all about making the reader’s life better. This automatically makes you a welcome guest in their inbox.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Let’s go through a real life example so you can see exactly how this unfolds when you’re working with clients.</p>
            <p>We’ll start with a thought experiment: Imagine I asked you to write an email selling labor law posters to small businesses who are legally required to purchase updated posters every year, like this one:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/labor-law-poster.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/labor-law-poster.png"></p>
            <p>If you had no other information, you might think:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What should I write about?"</li>
                <li>"Which features and benefits of the product should I highlight?"</li>
                <li>"Should I use fear tactics to get them to buy right away?"</li>
                <li>"Should I figure out what the common objections are, and try to overcome them?"</li>
                <li>"Should I research competitors’ prices and show them why this is a good deal?"</li>
                <li>"Should I start with a story? I heard that stories are great to use in emails"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>NO, NO, NO.</p>
            <p>All you have to do is a simple role reversal. Ask yourself, what does the person reading the email NEED? What’s the BEST way to help them get it?</p>
            <p>Switching over to this mentality may take some practice. But once you get used to it, &nbsp; <strong>you’ll be able to answer all of the above questions with shocking speed and accuracy</strong> <strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>Check out what I wrote for one of my clients in the exact situation I’ve described. As you read through it, see if you can figure out WHY I made the decisions I made (we’ll do a thorough analysis afterward, but in the meantime, no peeking)…</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-182151.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-182151.png"></p>
            <p>Now this is a very simple email, and it didn’t take me long to write it. But everything in it is carefully designed to cater to the specific person receiving the email: A small business owner who may need a new labor law poster.</p>
            <p>Let’s do a complete analysis so you can see my thought process going in:</p>
            <h4>1. Selling a product is not my only goal.</h4>
            <p>This is very counterintuitive, but it works. I’m first and foremost helping the business owner stay compliant with the law and avoid fines.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It’s not that my goal isn’t to sell. It is! But giving value is an equal&nbsp;priority. I’m a helpful advisor as much as I am a&nbsp;copywriter and salesperson.&nbsp;</p>

            <h4>2. Understand what they need.</h4>
            <p>No one really cares about labor law posters. Yes, it’s something that’s important to the reader’s business, but as far as they’re concerned it’s a TINY detail of their overall operation.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you were a small business owner, would you have the time or energy to concern yourself with the finer details of different labor law poster packages, compliance laws, or whether or not you could save $5 by price shopping on Amazon? Of course not! You’re busy running your business.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You’d just want to know WHEN your current poster expires, and HOW to get a new one as quickly and easily as possible.&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>3. Help them get what they want.</h4>
            <p>Notice how I immediately focus in on what’s important to them, making everything extremely clear and fluid so they barely even need to think. All the information they need is right here in this email.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I even taught them how to check if they need new labor law posters &nbsp;in <strong>30 seconds</strong> , and added 2 call to action buttons to make their lives easier and save them time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And I made sure to mention that the all-in-one poster we were selling was EVERYTHING they needed to stay compliant and avoid fines. This is very important because it prevents them from procrastinating -- they know they can just click, and be done with it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>This email improved my client’s conversions by more than 300% over the previous version they were using.</strong></p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-173913.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-173913.png"> Will this exact same strategy work for every email you write? Of course not. As we discussed earlier, all emails are different.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And, as you’ll recall from Module 1, there’s no one "correct" way to write any piece of copy. I could have written the above email in any number of different ways. But the process of getting into the reader’s head and figuring out how to get them&nbsp;to take action is non-negotiable.</p>
            <p>That’s why it’s always critical to do a role reversal and ask yourself -- <strong>&nbsp;what does this person need, and how can I help them get it?</strong> &nbsp; When you do that, your copy will naturally move in the right direction.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center">Chameleon copywriting: How to adjust&nbsp;your approach for any&nbsp;situation</h3>
            <p>Remember, you need to adjust your strategy to fit the particular situation of each email you write. Sometimes, the differences between these situations can be subtle.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Let’s look at another email I wrote, also for small business owners -- except this time, the circumstances were slightly different, calling for radically different email copy.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In this case, the business owner signed up to receive a report called "7 Hiring Mistakes Most Bosses Make–and How to Avoid Them".</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-173841.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-173841.png"></p>
            <p>Since this email also went out to small business owners, you may be wondering why it’s so much longer than the previous one. Great question!</p>
            <p>There are a few reasons why I chose to write it this way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hiring employees is an expensive, emotional, and risky&nbsp;decision for business owners, creating a great opportunity for me to offer valuable, helpful content to the reader.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The benefits of a labor law poster ("avoid fines" and "stay compliant") are more obvious than the benefits of the system we’re offering in this email -- so a&nbsp;bit more "selling" makes sense.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>In this case, the reader specifically requested INFORMATION about how to hire employees&nbsp;(they signed up to receive a free report). Whereas in the first email, we can assume readers don’t want to LEARN about labor law posters -- they just want the fastest, easiest path to staying compliant and avoiding fines.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is why it’s so important to cultivate your Detective Mindset and focus on accomplishing your email copywriting goals in a systematic way, rather than using a rigid set of rules.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Think of the end result you’re looking for, gather every clue you can find, and work backwards to help the reader take the action that will help them.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>How to&nbsp;warm readers up before the sale</strong></h3>
            <p>Whenever possible, you want to delay your sales pitch to readers for at least the first couple of emails.</p>
            <p>Think of a rock concert or stand up comedy show.&nbsp; Whether it’s Metallica playing at Madison Square Garden, or Louis CK at The Beacon Theater, they all have one thing in common: They never go right up on stage.&nbsp; They always warm the audience up with an opening act before the main attraction.</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/metallica.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/metallica.png">

                    Creative Commons image via &nbsp; <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m-a-r-k/5358372861/">Mark Wainwright</a>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Email copywriting works the same way. You’ll usually do better by warming readers up first.&nbsp;The more expensive the product (or service), the more important this strategy becomes.</p>
            <p>That’s why marketing emails are sometimes referred to as&nbsp;lead nurturing, follow up, or <em>autoresponder</em> &nbsp; emails.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Regardless of what you (or the client) call it, it simply means that you send valuable information with no strings attached -- at least for the first 2-3 emails.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This helps you gain trust, build goodwill, and makes it more likely readers will open your emails. If you do it right, they may even anxiously look forward to hearing from you when you’re finally ready to sell them something.</p>
            <p>Check out this lead nurturing email I wrote for one of my clients, a car dealer, to send to customers who’d requested a price quote from the dealership’s website:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-172400.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-172400.png"></p>
            <p>Notice how this email teaches the reader something that’s relevant, useful, and surprising -- with zero selling.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Contrast that with the&nbsp;typical pushy email you’d expect to receive from a car dealer, like this one:</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-172128.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-172128.png"><br>
                <figcaption>
                    A typical car dealer email -- UGH.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>…and you can see why it stands out, gets attention, and builds trust.</p>
            <p>Once you do this, it becomes much easier to transition into selling later on.</p>
            <p>Check out this snippet from my well known "Top 5 Upwork Hacks" email series, where I transition from a valuable tip, to selling (in email #3):</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-172457.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-172457.png"></p>
            <p>In fact, every&nbsp;email in the original series contained valuable information -- even the sales emails.</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-172742.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-172742.png"></p>
            <p>Notice how simple it was -- yet it was also incredibly effective.&nbsp;Far from distracting readers from the sale, teaching something surprising and helpful makes sales emails even more powerful.</p>
            <p>Naturally, this is also the&nbsp;default approach I use when writing email sequences for clients. They love it, because it offers their readers tons of value, and -- when done right -- leads to even more conversions.</p>

            <h4 style="text-align:center"><strong>"But Danny, how do&nbsp;I come up with ideas for email copy?"</strong></h4>
            <p>One of the hallmarks of great freelance copywriters is that they’re always able to come up with ideas for fresh email copy -- seemingly on demand.</p>
            <p>Many copywriters struggle with this, but there’s no need to make it overly complicated.</p>
            <p>Watch the video below to see how I come up with great ideas for email copy -- in any situation.</p>
            <video controls="controls" height="auto" width="100%">

            <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
            </video>
            <p>To show you how valuable clients can be in helping you come up with ideas, here’s an example of a very effective email one of my clients sent out to his prospects (camp owners who’ve expressed interest in updating their websites):</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/camp-owners-email-with-commentary.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/camp-owners-email-with-commentary.png"></p>
            <p>Remember, clients are full of great insights like these, but it’s up to you to ask the right questions in order to uncover it.</p>
            <h3>How to use stories to surprise and entertain readers (even if you’re not a "natural storyteller")</h3>
            <p>Let me ask you an honest question: Do the words "new blog post" get you visibly excited?</p>
            <p>I didn’t think so.</p>
            <p>Yet one of my most popular emails of all time was an announcement for a new blog post I’d written. It got an open and click rate that destroyed&nbsp;industry averages.</p>
            <p>My secret? I didn’t start off talking about the blog post. Instead, I hooked readers with a story:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-184213.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-184213.png"></p>
            <p>I use stories every chance I get, whether I’m selling or teaching -- and whether it’s an FTW email, or something I’m writing for a client.</p>
            <p>People love stories because they’re one of the oldest forms of human communication and connection.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We’ve been telling stories for tens of thousands of years. It’s literally in our DNA, which is why even simple stories have the potential to captivate us.</p>
            <p>Used properly, a good story can act like a trojan horse, delivering your client’s message without&nbsp;feeling like a sleazy marketing email.</p>
            <h4>"But Danny, what if I don’t have any stories to tell?"</h4>
            <p>A few years ago, I had no captivating stories to tell. At least, that’s what I told myself at the time.</p>
            <p>Today, I have a file that contains DOZENS upon dozens of interesting writing prompts at any given time.</p>
            <p>What changed?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Did I suddenly become a VIP or socialite who rubs shoulders with celebrities and elite business people and politicians? Hmm, let me think ab-- no.</p>
            <p>The only thing that changed is psychological. Once I realized that even the simplest stories make for amazing emails, I’m constantly on the lookout for even the smallest nuggets that can turn an ordinary email from&nbsp;okay… to GREAT.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of writing great email copy, a story can be ANYTHING surprising (preferably with some educational or practical value). Even a small factoid can work wonders.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You don’t even need to come up with it on your own! Some of the best performing emails I’ve written use stories I found online, in books, or even in movies.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For example, this story appeared in my Facebook news feed one morning, and I wrote it down knowing I’d eventually use it in an email:</p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-185129.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-185129.png">
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <figcaption>
                    I got this entire story from an article I read online
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Practically the entire email is comprised of that one story, and I didn’t come up with so much as one single detail on my own.</p>
            <p>Great stories are all around you. You just need to switch from&nbsp;passive consumer &nbsp; to&nbsp;active listener.</p>
            <p>Whenever I come across (or think of) anything surprising or interesting, I immediately write a note about it into a file called "writing prompts".</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of 100% non-original "stories" that are sitting in my Writing Prompts file:&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poker champion Phil Ivey once said he doesn’t sit at the poker table with a pre-determined strategy. Instead, his actions depend on what the other players do. (I learned this from a TV show about poker.)</li>
                    <li>Great pickpockets usually have an accomplice who warns people that there’s a pickpocketer on site and urges them to check to make sure their wallets are safe. When people feel for their wallets, the real pickpocketer knows which pocket they keep it in. (I saw this in a TED talk online.)</li>
                    <li>A guy paid the DMV using 300,000 pennies, just to make a point. (I saw this story on Twitter.)</li>
                    <li>Most people have no clue that the famous novelist Stephen King used to be a high school teacher and live in a trailer. Or that his first bestseller,&nbsp;Carrie , came close to ending up in the trash. (I read about these nuggets in Stephen King’s book, &nbsp;On Writing. )</li>
                    <li>Chris Rock’s performance at Madison Square Garden on New Year’s Eve seems like second nature, but what you didn’t see was how he painstakingly tested and refined his jokes behind the scenes for twelve straight months beforehand. (I read about this in a magazine.)</li>
</ul>
            <p>You can use these if you want to. I don’t care… I’m constantly adding new ones. Remember, they’re literally everywhere so there’s never a shortage of good ones.</p>
            <p>Now let’s talk about how I use these prompts to come up with great email copy clients love.</p>
            <h3><strong>Email alchemy: Turning interesting nuggets into pure copywriting gold&nbsp;</strong></h3>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages of starting with cool stories is that it doesn’t take much effort to transform them into great copy.</p>
            <p>It’s like oatmeal -- a bit of brown sugar and maple syrup&nbsp;are easy additions that make it taste great.</p>
            <p>The trick is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make sure you connect the story to the email copy you’re writing.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you need to throw in a "twist" in order to make it fit. My friend Chris Davis, a great email copywriter, calls this approach "Turning the Corner".</p>
            <p>Here’s an example of how I start with an interesting nugget from my writing prompts file, then&nbsp;turn the corner &nbsp; to connect it to the copy I’m writing:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-185330.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-185330.png"> You can also spice things up a bit more, if you want to.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the following example , I decided to use a story about the movie star Sylvester Stallone to reveal misconceptions about success. I could have just come right out and told the story, but I decided to tease people first by opening with a fun word association game:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-185459.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-185459.png"></p>
            <p>It’s OK to play around like this, as long as you make sure each line will invoke enough surprise and curiosity to draw the reader in. In this case, I knew people wouldn’t be able to resist the game, making this a powerful, curiosity driven opening.</p>
            <p>You can even use stories to jazz up emails in "boring" industries. Here’s an example from an email that one FTW student wrote for her client, a B2B company:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-185410.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-185410.png"></p>
            <p>I love this! Here’s a freelancer&nbsp;writing about a dreary technical topic, so she infuses the copy with something weird and interesting to draw readers’ interest. Well done.</p>
            <p>In case you’re wondering where she came up with the interesting tidbit about poker… She learned it from my Secrets Of A Six-Figure Upworker course! Remember, there are interesting nuggets EVERYWHERE -- it’s just a matter of making it a habit to notice them and write them down.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(Btw, it’s also worth noting that she knew absolutely nothing about "HHCAHPS surveys" before working with this client. Remember, great copywriters are detectives…they make it their business to learn about their clients industries.)</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center">Topping your copy off with an amazing subject line</h3>
            <p>Once you’ve written your email copy, it’s time to pair it with an irresistible subject line.</p>
            <p>Check out the video below to see my exact process for coming up with subjects that make readers want to open -- consistently and predictably.</p>
            
            <video controls="controls" height="auto" width="100%">
            <source src="NBImages/FCCvideos/FCC-M2-2---subject-line.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
            <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
            </video>
            <p>Here’s a real example of&nbsp;how I used this exact process to come up with one of my best performing subject lines ever:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-173528.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-173528.png"></p>
            <p>Notice how a few of them are terrible…most are OK…and a few are excellent. The idea is to end up with a few great choices clients will love.</p>
            <p>One final note on subject lines: Make sure to keep them as short as possible, especially since most people are checking email on their phone. The last thing you want is to write a great subject line that gets cut off by a mobile screen.</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171102-173723.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171102-173723.png"></p>

            <h4 style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:25px;">Bonus: Never-Get-Stuck Ingredient List"</h4>
            <p>Feeling stuck on an email, or just unsure of what to write next?</p>
            <p>Here are a few of my favorite "ingredients" you can use to get over the hump. Just go through this list, pick the one you think would fit best, and bam -- you’re back in business.</p>
            <p><strong>Create urgency.</strong> It’s never a bad idea to give readers extra motivation to act. Urgency, or any other type of scarcity are great ways to do that. Is a sale ending soon? Will prices be going up? Are there a limited number of products, free consults, or webinar seats? All of these are great examples of how to use strategic urgency to enhance your email copy.</p>
            <p>You can also get creative! For example, I once paid $1,500 for one of James Altucher’s evergreen products after reading his email saying the "price would probably go up soon."</p>
            <p><strong>Write a bulleted list.</strong> You could write bullets about a lead magnet, a product or service, a list of features and benefits, a webinar, or anything else. I even use bullet points to "sell" readers on clicking through to a blog post or other article. One of my clients used to say that "great copywriters think in bullet points" -- a lesson that has stuck with me ever since.</p>
            <p><strong>Tell a success story.</strong> I always like to ask clients if they have any stories or case studies about people they’ve helped through their business. These can be great material for your email copy. You can tell the long version, the short version, or even include multiple stories in one email.</p>
            <p>If the client doesn’t have any success stories to share, you can even tell someone else’s success story, as long as it’s relevant. You obviously don’t want to misrepresent it as one of your client’s success stories, but it’s OK to use other people’s stories to make a point as long as you’re clear that they’re not a customer of your client.</p>
            <p><strong>FAQ.</strong> A list of frequently asked questions and answers about a product or service is an excellent go-to piece of any autoresponder sequence. You can combine it with any of the other approaches in this course, or even just use it on its own.</p>
            <p>The client may have a FAQ list already, so be sure to ask. If they don’t, be prepared to help them come up with one (remember to charge them for your time if you do this).</p>
            <p><strong>Testimonials.</strong> These are similar to success stories, but more succinct. Many clients will tend to have some testimonials on hand, even if they don’t have case studies, so these are a great backup. Adding one or more testimonials can also a great way to spice up any email.</p>
            <p><strong>Describe a product or service.</strong> As obvious as this sounds, I can’t tell you how often an email series fails to actually discuss the product or service being offered. Email readers aren’t mind readers, so if you’re writing copy for something that needs to be described, don’t forget to do it.</p>
            <p><strong>A helpful insight or story.</strong> Remember to keep a running list of these on your own as "writing prompts." You’ll find tons of them in your everyday life and reading list, once you start looking.</p>
            <p>It can be something as simple as "Coffee used to be considered unhealthy, but now everyone says it’s healthy! It just goes to show you that conventional wisdom is often totally backwards..."</p>
            <p>Or, "Did you see this article about the guy who brought $300,000 in PENNIES to the DMV? Some people will do anything to get a point across…"</p>
            <p><strong>A link to the product or service you’re offering.</strong> Most emails include one at the bottom, but there’s no rule that says you can’t have multiple. In fact, placing 2 or more links throughout your email copy can often improve the click through rate, so feel free to try it out.</p>
            <p><strong>Explain how something works.</strong> Unless something is blatantly obvious it’s hard to go wrong by including at least a brief explanation of it. This can be as straightforward as bulleting out a simple 3 step process (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3) to really spell it out for your readers -- while also making the copy feel more valuable.</p>
            <p><strong>Links to helpful articles.</strong> Linking out to content from high quality sources (especially big sites) is a great way to give extra value, improve your own credibility, and make your copy more powerful.</p>
            <p><strong>A useful fact, statistic or quote.</strong> Whatever you’re writing about, there’s a good chance you can find a useful stat, quote, or factoid to back it up. If you feel like your copy can use one, just Google it and see what comes up.</p>
            <p><strong>Credibility markers.</strong> If your client has a well known customer or partner company, pointing that out can be a great way to boost their credibility with readers. Or if they’ve ever been featured on a popular site or podcast, mentioning that (and maybe even linking to it) can achieve a similar effect.</p>
            <p><strong>Create a positive association.</strong> Talking about something that makes people feel good -- even if seems totally unrelated to your client -- can be a great way to create a positive association in readers’ minds.</p>
            <p>For example, you might relay a story about Steve Jobs to make a point about business, mention a surprising fact about Disney World, or talk about a beautiful Caribbean Island.</p>
            <p><strong>Pose a socratic question.</strong> Asking a question can be a powerful tactic because it transforms the reader from passive consumer of your copy, to active participant. Even a question as simple as "Would it be worth 2 minutes to find out if you could save $2,000 or more?" immediately activates the reader’s imagination and makes them feel involved in the conversation.</p>
            <p><strong>Describe their problem in detail.</strong> Readers love it when you understand the exact problem they’re trying to solve. The better you can explain it, the more understood they feel, and the more likely they are to take the action you want them to take.</p>
            <p>This works best when you use the same words they use to describe the problem, so be sure to ask the client for some good intel. I always like to ask clients, <em>"How would the reader describe the problem to her husband?"</em> If the client doesn’t know, that’s a good sign that you should be interviewing their readers or customers.</p>
            <p><strong>A "PS" section at the end of the email.</strong> You can fill it with any of the above ideas or something totally different -- your choice.</p>

            <p>How HHCAHPS surveys affect your 5-star rating (and your bottom line)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Email Body:</strong></p>
            <p>Hi NAME,</p>
            <p>It’s hard to know where to start with all the different quality measures you now have to keep track of for Value Based Purchasing.</p>
            <p>And every year, all of these tiny little metrics will be added up to give you a quality score. Based on the score, your "quality-adjusted" payment rate can really help or hurt your bottom line.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But you already provide your patients with the best quality of care -- so you’re good right?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There’s one thing that trips up even the best home health agencies though.</p>
            <p>The HHCAHPS surveys.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Did you know that you need at least 40 completed surveys to even receive a rating? One less, and your results aren’t considered statistically significant.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But that’s simple enough right? Just get 40 surveys and you’re good to go.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Here’s the issue: How do you get your patients to return the darn thing?</p>
            <p>You might provide your patients with the best quality of treatment possible, but still end up losing out to the organizations that have implemented strategies for getting their surveys back.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>If you’re struggling to get your HHCAHPS surveys back, you’re not alone.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>That’s why I asked [PRESENTER NAME], the senior clinical consultant at [COMPANY NAME], to lead our next webinar as part of our Outcome Improvements series. It’s literally called "How do I get them to send back those surveys?"</p>

            <p>How professional poker can increase your survey return rates</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Email Body:</strong></p>
            <p>Hi NAME,</p>
            <p>In our last email, we talked about how your HHCAHPS survey return rate can have a huge impact on your agency’s bottom line.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But it can often feel like you have almost no control over this part of your rating…you can’t choose the questions that go in the survey, change the wording, or even send them out yourself!</p>
            <p><strong>How can you improve something with so many restrictions in the way?</strong></p>
            <p>To answer this question, let’s turn to professional poker. Yes, the card game.</p>
            <p>In poker, there’s a concept known as "small edges." These are small, recurring advantages that can pay out big over time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The thing is, they’re almost invisible to amateur players who think that the point of poker is to just bet, raise, and fold. But professional players will seek out small edges in every hand.</p>
            <p>By gaining even a 1% advantage and compounding it over time, the professionals come out on top every time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The same principles apply when trying to boost your survey return rate. <strong>There are so many simple techniques you can use to gain an edge over your competition.</strong></p>
            <p>For example, did you know that you can customize surveys with your own branding?</p>
            <p>It’s such a simple thing to add, but many agencies completely overlook it. All you need to do is contact your survey administration vendor and ask to have you logo added to both the cover letter and the survey.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This one quick change makes it easier to patients to identify the source of the letter or email – making it much less likely that they’ll throw it in the trash with all their credit card offers and campaign flyers.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>In our next webinar, we’ll cover many more of these "small edges" and give you an actionable plan for increasing your survey return rates.&nbsp;</strong></p>
