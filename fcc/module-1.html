</ul>
<p>Next week, you’ll be hitting the ground running and learning exactly how I write specific types of copy.</p>
<p>But first it’s important to take a step back and ask the million dollar question: How do top freelance copywriters consistently deliver fantastic, EFFECTIVE copy — that clients love — every single time?</p>
<p>This question gets especially fun when you consider that many of the top pros aren’t even great writers!</p>
<p>Moreover, for every piece of conventional copywriting wisdom you read about, I can show you HUNDREDS of top paid professionals who buck the rules and still achieve massive success.</p>
<p>The truth is, being a great freelance copywriter isn’t about tactics   — like “writing like you talk,” “understanding features vs. benefits,” or cute acronyms like AIDA.</p>
<p>Those can be helpful — and you’ll find all of my best tactics for writing great copy in this course (including formulas, templates, and everything else you need to systemize your copywriting).</p>
<p>But it all starts with having the right mindsets. Because those are the common thread all top freelance copywriters possess — in spades.</p>
<p>To emulate the success of elite freelance copywriters, you need to think   like them.</p>
<p>Let’s get specific! There are 3 key mindsets all top freelance copywriters have in common. Watch the video below to learn what they are, and how you can adopt them to fuel your own freelance copywriting success.</p>
<h3><strong> Three Critical Mindsets of Top Freelance Copywriters </strong></h3>
<div><strong> The catch-22 of writing copy that converts </strong>
<p>Conversion copywriting is one of the most misunderstood aspects in all of marketing. For this reason, new and even more experienced copywriters often wonder if they really “have what it takes” to write copy that converts. </p>
<p>Many more stay stuck in the trap of, “How can I get hired to write copy that converts without having a previous ‘track record’?” </p>
<p>I used to worry about this too. But over the years I’ve discovered that these fears are based on 2 common misconceptions.   </p>
<p><strong> MISCONCEPTION #1: </strong>   The first is the underlying assumption that you’re SOLELY responsible for making sure your copy converts. In the real world, that isn’t how it works.</p>
<p>In the hit TV show Mad Men, top-gun copywriter Don Draper sums up this wisdom beautifully when he says to a client: “It’s not a science. We’ll do our best.”</p>
<p><img style="border: 2px solid red; min-width: 50px; padding: 50px; margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;" src="NBImages/20171115-161322.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171115-161322.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image"alt="image should be here"/></p>
<p>Even though Mad Men is just a TV show, the writers did an amazing job of nailing the reality of how conversion copywriting really works.</p>
<p><strong> MISCONCEPTION #2: </strong> : The second misconception is equally false: Many people assume that “conversion copywriting” requires some mystical ability that only a few lucky writers are born with. </p>
<h3><strong> The truth is, writing effective copy is a learned skill that anyone can get the hang of — oftentimes fairly quickly. </strong></h3>
<p>In fact, you’ve been writing conversion copy your whole life! </p>
<div>If you’ve ever:</div>
<ul>
<li>Sent an email to a coworker requesting a meeting, </li>
<li>Successfully recommended a movie to someone  over text,</li>
<li>Or asked a friend out to lunch on Facebook Messenger</li>
</ul>
<div>Then congratulations — you’ve successfully proven you’re capable of writing copy that converts.</div>
<p><img style="border: 2px solid red; min-width: 50px; padding: 50px; margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;" src="NBImages/20171115-161301.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171115-161301.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image"alt="image should be here"/></p>
<p>Other so-called “experts” love to write long articles about things like A/B testing, and  more “scientific” conversion tactics.</p>
<p>But the truth is, when you break it down, “conversion copy” simply means  words that get people to take action . </p>
<p>And it is more art than science.  </p>
<p>It’s an intuition you can develop once you get into the habit of thinking about how people react to things.</p>
<p>Now let’s dive in so you can see exactly how it’s done. </p>
<h3>The masterful psychology behind effective copy </h3>
<p>Over the next 6 weeks, you’ll learn specific tactics for writing the various types of copy we’ll be covering. For now, I want to start by giving you a solid understanding of how the best freelance copywriters approach the art and science of conversion copy.</p>
<p>The first thing to realize is that, when it comes to writing copy that converts, there is no one-size-fits-all blueprint. If there were, it would be as easy as bagging groceries… Anyone could do it, and clients wouldn’t happily pay hundreds of dollars per hour for top notch copywriters.</p>
<p>This is also why rigid tools, like formulas and checklists, aren’t the magical solutions they’re sometimes made out to be. A great copywriter isn’t a box-checker! You need to be flexible and adapt to different situations.</p>
<h4><strong style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">A better approach is to train your brain to be what I call a Conversion Machine.  </strong></h4>
<p>In other words, you can develop an INTUITION about conversion copy which is 100x more powerful and reliable than any checklist or formula.  </p>
<div>This is similar to the way the world’s most charismatic people operate.</div>
</div>
<div><img style="border: 2px solid red; min-width: 50px; padding: 50px; margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;" src="NBImages/20171115-160909.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171115-160909.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image"alt="image should be here"/></div>
<p>Like conversion copywriting, being charismatic can require different behaviors depending on the situation. Masters of charisma understand this; they know there’s no way to manage all of the variables (like posture, tone, etc.) using checklists. </p>
<p>Instead, they focus on ONE thing — like confidence, relaxation, or caring — and the correct posture, tone, and other charismatic behaviors naturally follow.</p>
<p>This discovery was an incredible eye-opener for me, because it describes almost exactly how I’ve always approached Conversion Copywriting.</p>
<p>I focus on ONE thing above all else…</p>
<p><strong> The most powerful tool for writing conversion copy </strong></p>
<p>If you ask most copywriters what the most important component of conversion copywriting is, you’ll get answers like…</p>
<ul>
<li>“Emphasize benefits, not just features”</li>
<li>“Know your audience’s pain points”</li>
<li>“Create urgency!”</li>
</ul>
<p>These are useful things to keep in mind. But the most critical factor in writing conversion copy is  <strong> understanding the reader’s story . </strong></p>
<p>The reason stories are so powerful is that they reveal golden psychological nuggets that make your copy 100x more effective.</p>
<div>For this reason, one of  the first things I say to new clients is, “ <strong> Tell me the story of the person that we’re writing to. </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Often, they answer with something like this: “Oh, OK. My target audience is busy moms who want to save time.” Or, “Our readers are startup entrepreneurs with 5-15 employees.”</p>
<p>Those may be interesting facts, but they’re not a story.</p>
<p>For example, if I tell you that “The Queen died and then the King fell ill” — those are just facts.</p>
<p>Whereas “The Queen died and then the King fell ill   of a broken heart”   is a STORY.</p>
<p>Do you see the difference? Again, notice how the story is psychologically revealing, opening the door for great copy.</p>
<p>To drive this point home further, let’s return to our “busy entrepreneur with 5-15 employees” for just a minute. Let’s say I asked you to write an email selling remote bookkeeping services to them.</p>
<p>How would you know what to write about?</p>
<p>Sure, you have some facts… You know the reader owns a growing business, and presumably needs bookkeeping services. You can even imagine he’d love to save some time and money. </p>
<p>But when you sit down to write, suddenly, you’ll notice you don’t have much to go on.</p>
<p> You might say something like, “We can save you time,” or, “We can save you money!” But your copy is going to be generic, bland, and ineffective because you’re missing the STORY that’s driving it.</p>
<p><strong> On the other hand, see how different things are when I tell you a </strong><strong>story </strong> <strong>  instead: </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em> John started a business a few years ago. At first, he did everything on his own, and didn’t have much need for a bookkeeper. Now, he has 5 employees, and his company is growing quickly.   </em></p>
<p><em> He still doesn’t have his books in order… He knows he needs to figure it out, but he’s confused about how and overwhelmed with running his business.   </em></p>
<p><em> He doesn’t think he needs a full time bookkeeper, but can he really trust a part time or remote person to handle sensitive financial information? He isn’t even sure if he can afford it…but then again, how can he afford NOT to get his company’s finances in order?   </em></p>
<p><em> Every time he thinks about it, it makes him want to run and hide…maybe take the afternoon off and go to the movies to get his mind off of it. But like a monster under the bed that just won’t go away, he knows the problem will only get worse until he finally faces it head on.   </em></p>
<p><em> Still, he has no idea HOW to even do that. SIGH. One day he goes onto Facebook to procrastinate and distract himself from the pressures of work, and, lo and behold, he sees an ad for bookkeeping services.   </em></p>
<p><em> He signs up to find out how the service can help HIM…which is where your email comes in… </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>BAM! Look at all the awesome psychological nuggets you’ve just picked up. </p>
<p>It’s almost like a movie (except with no ending yet)… </p>
<ul>
<li>There’s an inciting incident (the growth of John’s company)</li>
<li>A burning desire (to get his company’s finances in order)</li>
<li>And even a villain (procrastination / analysis paralysis)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Look how quickly you go from not knowing what to write about, to having TONS of options for a great email — all from understanding John’s STORY.</p>
<h3><strong> 3 Rules for uncovering any reader’s story </strong></h3>
<h4><strong> Rule #1: Dig for the story </strong></h4>
<p>Occasionally, a client may have their customer’s story all figured out. But most of the time, it’s up to you to go looking for it. </p>
<p>The following case study shows a real life example of how I did this — and how I unearthed a “hidden” detail that paid off in an unexpected way. </p>
<h4><strong> Rule #2: Don’t be fooled by false stories </strong></h4>
<div>
<p>Why are Coca-Cola advertisements loaded with words like friends ,  family , and  happiness   — and never words like drink ,  hydration , or  flavor ?</p>
<p><img style="border: 2px solid red; min-width: 50px; padding: 50px; margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;" src="NBImages/20171115-160749.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171115-160749.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image"alt="image should be here"/></p>
<p>Coca-Cola’s writers long ago figured out that people don’t primarily choose Coke because they’re thirsty.</p>
<p>Great copywriters train themselves to see past the obvious. You should always be digging beneath the surface to find the deeper truths.</p>
<p>Read through the following case study to find out how I spot false stories — and push past them to get to the heart of the real story. </p>

<h3><strong> Case study: high-end ($30,000) websites </strong></h3>
<p>One of my clients, Brian, builds expensive websites for high-end resorts.</p>
<p>When I first asked him to tell me the story of his clients, he told me they were “resort owners who wanted a new website so they could get more customers.”</p>
<p>I knew there had to be more to it.</p>
<p>For one thing, there are TONS of ways to get more customers — many of which cost less than a $30,000 website (e.g. Facebook ads, referrals, etc).</p>
<p>So I put on my Detective Hat and tried to dig deeper. Unfortunately, like many business owners, Brian was so busy running his company, he never had the time to develop a deeper understanding of his customers.</p>
<p>To get to the bottom of things, I decided to personally talk to 3 of Brian’s customers to learn about their stories (I charged Brian extra for this, and it was worth every penny).</p>
<p>Here are some of the things they told me:</p>
<ul>
<li>“We were looking for a redesign because our site looked OLD and OUTDATED.”</li>
<li>“Our old site wasn’t showing up on the front page of google search results… We really wanted to get more visitors to our site.”</li>
<li>“Someone left us a Yelp review saying they loved our resort and would have booked an additional WEEK, except they had no idea how beautiful it was until they arrived.” (In other words, the website didn’t accurately reflect the quality of the resort.)</li>
<li>“We were told there were parts of the site that were hard to find once customers were on it.”</li>
<li>“We realized we needed a new site 5 years ago… But we’re too busy running the business to spend time focusing on it.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Bingo! These are the kind of details no data-analysis report can produce, and they’re INCREDIBLY powerful.</p>
<p>Knowing how to uncover them allows me to write more effective copy, faster, and with less effort. It’s almost like half of my job is done before I even sit down and start typing.</p>
<p>For example, using the insights above, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write an email about how the service helps someone with these exact challenges and mental barriers.</li>
<li>Write a case study about one of the customers who’s found the service helpful.</li>
<li>Write a “Frequently Asked Questions” email that answers all of the concerns and objections I’ve picked up through my research.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I’d simply gone off Brian’s original (false) story, my copy would have been generic, bland, and ineffective. But because I’m trained to sniff out decoy information and figure out the real story, I was able to help my client increase his profits by tens of thousands of dollars each year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4><strong> Rule #3: “Follow the Queen” </strong></h4>
<p>Few moments in copywriting are more satisfying than nailing that reader’s story. But beware: Stories aren’t static — like mythical Shapeshifters, they can morph and change in subtle ways depending on the piece of copy you’re writing.</p>
<p>For this reason, it’s important to ask, “What’s the story driving THIS piece of copy?” — every time you sit down to write something new. </p>
<p>It’s like the old street hustler’s card game, “Follow the Queen”.</p>
<p> <img style="border: 2px solid red; min-width: 50px; padding: 50px; margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;" src="NBImages/20171115-160733.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171115-160733.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image"alt="image should be here"/></p>
<p>At first glance, the game looks easy enough: Just keep your eye on the Queen as the dealer moves the cards around — and you win.</p>
<p>But that feeling of complacency is exactly what the hustler is banking on! Unsuspecting rookies soon discover that following a moving target isn’t as easy as they thought.</p>
<p>As a copywriter, you don’t need to overcome insurmountable odds, or play with a deck that’s stacked against you. But you do need to stay on your toes and make sure you’re always paying attention to the right story for the copy you’re writing.</p>
<p>The following real life case study illustrates this concept in action perfectly.</p>
<div class="content-box-fcc">
<div class="content-box-fcc">
<h3><strong> Case study: Writing the “last call” email before raising the price of Secrets Of A Six-Figure Upworker </strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes the strategy you use to write high converting copy depends more on the situation — and less on the person you’re writing to.</p>
<p>For example…</p>
<p>It was <a dir="ltr" href="x-apple-data-detectors://2"> Friday, 6pm Central Time </a> .  The price of my first course, Secrets Of A Six-Figure Upworker, was about to jump by several hundred dollars.</p>
<p>There were just a few hours left to purchase before the increase. It was time to send the “final reminder” email.</p>
<p>But how do I decide what to write about? What strategy will maximize the number of conversions we get?</p>
<p>On goes my Detective Hat.</p>
<p>At first glance, it might seem like we should hammer home the fact that there are just a few hours left to buy the course (at least at the current price).</p>
<p>It’s definitely worth mentioning. But, contrary to popular belief, it’s unlikely to increase conversions at this late hour — for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone reading the email already knows the price is about to go up</li>
<li>Most of the people who were planning to buy have already bought by now</li>
<li>So the main purpose of <em> this last </em> email is to convert anyone who’s still <em> unsure </em></li>
</ol>
<p>So in this particular instance, making the “deadline” the centerpiece of the email would be an amateur mistake.</p>
<p>Knowing I needed a different direction, I thought about what other clues might be available to help me. I asked myself, what <em> do </em> people need to hear now in order to get them to buy tonight before the price goes up?</p>
<p>Could they need more details about the course?</p>
<p>Again, not likely. By now, we’ve already sent them all the information they could ever need to make a decision. If they haven’t decided by now, more info isn’t what’s going to tip the scales.</p>
<p>Let’s look deeper and see if there are any hidden clues that could help us solve this puzzle.</p>
<p>Based on the above logic, if the reader hasn’t bought yet, they’re either <em> planning </em> to buy tonight, or they’re still hesitant to pull the trigger. Those are the only 2 possible reasons.</p>
<p>Moreover, the latter group is the only one we care about at the moment — since anyone who was planning to buy is going to buy regardless of what this last email says!</p>
<p>At this point, I do a quick Role Reversal, putting myself in the shoes of the reader who’s hesitant. What are they hesitant <em> about </em> ?</p>
<p>Logically, there’s nothing to worry about because the course is backed by an ironclad money back guarantee. So their decision is completely reversible if they should decide they made a mistake. There’s literally nothing to lose.</p>
<p>But we don’t really buy things based on logic — we buy based on emotion. And we hesitate to buy based on emotion as well. In order to make a purchase (especially a substantial one), we need to <em> feel safe </em> .</p>
<p>There’s our hidden clue. Did you catch it? This last email needs to make the reader — who’s thinking about buying, but isn’t really sure — <em> feel safe about the purchase </em> .</p>
<p>So instead of doing what most copywriters would do — building the email around the “urgency” of the price going up — I needed to build it around the MONEY BACK GUARANTEE instead.</p>
<p>By the way, this is a great example of how your conversion strategy can change from situation to situation. And, in the case of an email sequence, from email to email! (You’ll learn more about the specifics of how to structure an email campaign in next week’s module.) This is why it’s more important to hone your Detective Mindset, rather than becoming obsessed with individual tactics.</p>
<p>Had this been any one of the emails <em> leading up to this point </em> , this strategy wouldn’t have worked. In that case, it can be smart to <em> mention </em> the guarantee, but making it the centerpiece of the email wouldn’t have been a good idea strategically.</p>
<p><img style="border: 2px solid red; min-width: 50px; padding: 50px; margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;" src="NBImages/20171115-155900.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171115-155900.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image"alt="image should be here"/></p>

<h3><strong> “But Danny, how do I know if clients will like my copy?” </strong></h3>
<p>Though the idea that you’re powerless to influence how clients feel about your copy is yet another misconception, it is based on a small grain of truth.</p>
<p>Let’s get this out of the way right now: It’s true that it isn’t just enough to write good copy. Or even effective   copy.</p>
<p>You need to write copy you know clients will love. If the person paying the bills isn’t happy with it, how can it be a true success?</p>
<p>Notice I didn’t say copy you “think” the client will love. Or worse, copy you “hope” they’ll be happy with.</p>
<p>Top freelance copywriters aren’t dice-rolling gamblers. They’re business people! And like any great business, they’re proficient at minimizing the risk of having customers walk away unhappy.</p>
<p>Think of a great restaurant. They don’t just make what they think is a good meal and then hope for the best.</p>
<p>Every detail — from the choice of ingredients, to the way the waiter describes the specials, and even how the chef presents the food at your table — is carefully designed to ensure you have an amazing experiencee.</p>
<p><img style="border: 2px solid red; min-width: 50px; padding: 50px; margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;" src="NBImages/20171115-155951.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171115-155951.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image"alt="image should be here"/></p>
<p>You’ll use this same approach in your freelance copywriting business. Instead of writing and hoping for the best, you’ll use careful planning to influence how clients feel about your work.</p>
<p>This all starts with gathering GREAT information. </p>
<p>Computer scientists have a saying: “Garbage in, garbage out.”</p>
<p>By learning how to get your hands on awesome information right up front, you can virtually guarantee your copy is successful — even before you write a single word of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong> My “Three-Eyed” Process for collecting great intel quickly (and hassle-free) </strong></h3>
<h4><strong> 1. Interrogate </strong></h4>
<p>All professional freelance copywriters know they should ask questions, but the masters excel at asking the RIGHT questions.</p>
<p>You’ll find plenty of great, non-obvious questions that can be very revealing and help you get amazing material for your copy inside the Bonus Section that accompanies this module.</p>
<p>For now, watch the video below to learn about my favorite one of all. I call it the “Magic Question”, and it took me years to discover it.</p>
</div>
<div class="textbox3" style="text-align: center;"><strong>My “Magic Question” for Discovering What Clients REALLY Want</strong></div>
<div class="textbox3">
<p> </p>
<h4><strong> 2. Imitate </strong></h4>
<p>I once spent days working on a piece of copy for a client — only to later find out he had a totally different vision in his head. I spent the next few days rewriting every word to his satisfaction.</p>
<p>It was a painful waste of time and money. But it was worth it because I learned a key lesson: </p>
<p>Sometimes, clients already have specific ideas for what they want to see in the copy. In those cases, your job is to “read their minds” and bring those ideas to life.</p>
<p>This is similar to how a barber might ask you to point out a hairstyle you like — BEFORE he cuts your hair.</p>
<p>Again, you’ll find specific questions related to this technique inside the Module 1 Bonus Section, but the general idea is that I’m looking for any of the following when talking with clients about their copy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific words or phrases they might like to see in the copy</li>
<li>A rough idea of how long (or short) they want it</li>
<li>A specific piece of copy they think is powerful</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, I have a concrete picture of what the client expects, before it’s too late. It’s one of my most effective tools for ensuring a successful outcome later on.</p>
<h4><strong style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">3. Investigate </strong></h4>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to pumping your clients for intel, you can also do your own sleuthing online. We touched on this earlier, but now let’s go deeper.</p>
<div>
<p>Some copywriters know they should check out the client’s website and social media pages. But why stop there?</p>
<p>You can — and should — look up their competitors! Remember, you’re not just a writer. You’re their Consigliere . Finding weak points in their competitors’ marketing will show them you care about helping them succeed, and you can exploit that info to make your copy even more powerful.</p>
<p>You may even find inspiration for good ideas the client hadn’t thought of before. Trust me, when clients find out you took the initiative of looking up their competitors so you can help them win, they will LOVE you.</p>
<p>If their product (or another one like it) is sold on a site like Amazon, look up the reviews. And don’t just look at the extreme 1 and 5 star reviews, either — it’s often the middling reviews that contain those hidden details and nuances that can lead to AMAZING copy.<br /> <img style="border: 2px solid red; min-width: 50px; padding: 50px; margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;" src="NBImages/20171115-160245.png" alt="NBImages/20171115-160245.png" /></p>
<p>Remember, you need to stay in that Detective Mindset and do whatever it takes to get that story .  </p>
<p>For example, a client once asked me to write some copy about a plumbing product neither of us were familiar with. So I called Home Depot and talked to a salesman in the plumbing department. He was happy to answer my questions, while the client was happy to pay me for the time — and the great copy it resulted in.</p>
<h3><strong> How top pros turn out fantastic copy in record time </strong></h3>
<p>You see it in all walks of life — the most productive people are also the most successful.</p>
<p>James Patterson, the #1 selling novelist in the world, writes 10 books every year.</p>
<p>Babe Ruth holds the record for hitting the most home runs in professional baseball — and also the most strikeouts.</p>
<p>Thomas Edison produced thousands of inventions, many of which you’ve never heard of.</p>
<p>Top freelance copywriters are no different. They get a lot done! Which is one of the reasons their clients are happy to pay them well.</p>

<p>To these productive copywriters, “Blank Page Syndrome” is Enemy #1. The less time you spend staring at a cursor and wondering what to write, the more money you’ll earn.</p>
<p>In each module, you’ll learn strategies and tactics for eliminating “BPS” in each specific type of copy you write.</p>
<p>But it all starts with understanding the one overarching secret to writing great copy quickly: Being willing to write BAD copy — then editing it later.</p>
<p>It’s 100x easier and faster to make a bad piece of copy great by editing it, than trying to sit down and write great copy…from scratch.</p>
<p>Because of that, I spend as little time as possible writing the first draft of my copy. </p>
<p>In fact I’ll intentionally write copy, knowing that it’s really bad, just to get SOMETHING down on the screen. Then, I’ll put most of my effort into EDITING it later.</p>
<h3>My 3-step technique for transforming rough drafts into pure gold</h3>
<h4>1. Remove anything that won’t SURPRISE them</h4>
<p>If the reader isn’t surprised by your copy, they aren’t learning anything new. And if your copy isn’t telling them anything they don’t already know, what’s the point?</p>
<p>Think of a great movie. Every scene, every line of dialogue is a new twist or turn you didn’t see coming. If they rehashed information you already knew, you’d get bored and demand your money back!</p>
<h4>2. Put each line through the “Great News! Filter”</h4>
<p>An awesome piece of copy makes readers hopeful that they’ll finally be able to achieve a burning desire in their life.</p>
<p>For that reason, your copy needs to pass what I call the “Great News! Filter”. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>You start off by picturing your reader bursting into their house  <a dir="ltr" href="x-apple-data-detectors://1"> at 5:30pm </a> , and telling their spouse about your copy, starting with the words “Great news!”</p>
<p>For example, look at the following tweet: </p>
<div><img style="border: 2px solid red; min-width: 50px; padding: 50px; margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;" src="NBImages/20171115-160654.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171115-160654.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image"alt="image should be here"/></div>
<p>In this case, you’d imagine someone excitedly saying the following sentence to his wife after walking through the door:</p>
<p>“Great news! I’m finally going to get a fresh perspective on world affairs!”</p>
<p>Does this sound like reality to you? </p>
<p>If the answer is yes, keep it. On the other hand, if it doesn’t pass the “Great News! Filter” — just rewrite it or cut it completely. </p>
<h4>3. Sprinkle in “Conversion Levers”</h4>
<p>Once my copy is boiled down to exciting, surprising information, it’s time to tune up its conversion potential.</p>
<p>Instead of reinventing the wheel every time I write copy, I look for opportunities to add proven Conversion Levers to shortcut my way to great copy that persuades and converts.</p>
<p>I’ll show you specific Conversion Levers to use for various types of copy throughout Freelance Copywriter’s Code. For now, here are a few of my favorite ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credibility</strong>.   Figure out what makes your client credible, and use it in your copy. Go beyond the obvious; even a single story from a happy customer can be used to your advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Story</strong>.   Did you notice how many stories I’ve told you in this module alone? Stories are a great way to make complicated ideas simple, understandable, and enjoyable. (You’ll learn more about how I find and use stories in my copy in the coming weeks.) </li>
<li><strong>Details</strong>.   Replacing abstract statements like “Be more productive” with something more concrete, like “Gain an extra hour every day,” is a great way to make your copy more persuasive.</li>
<li><strong>Urgency</strong>.  Is there anything you can say that will make someone act quickly? Expiring offers are fairly common, but you can also get creative! For example, I once paid $1,500 for one of James Altucher’s evergreen products after reading his email saying the “price would probably go up soon.” </li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to add all of these. Just try for as many as you can. Even 1 or 2 can be enough to take your copy from good to great.</p>
<h3>Module recap:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You’re not solely responsible for making sure your copy converts — clients pay you to do your best.</li>
<li>Conversion copywriting isn’t a mystical ability you need to be born with — it’s a learned skill anyone can get the hang of.</li>
<li>The most critical factor in writing conversion copy is understanding the reader’s STORY. If you get the story, you win.</li>
<li>To uncover the reader’s story, make sure to: Dig for the true narrative; don’t be fooled by false stories; and “Follow The Queen”</li>
<li>To write copy clients are virtually guaranteed to love, use my ”Three-Eyed” process for collecting great intel from clients: Interrogate, Imitate, Investigate. </li>
<li>Write your first draft quickly! Then shine it up quickly by removing anything that doesn’t surprise; putting each line through the “Great News! Filter”; and sprinkling in Conversion Levers for maximum impact.</li>
