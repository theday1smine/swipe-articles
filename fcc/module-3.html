<p>Press releases are one of my favorite types of copywriting.&nbsp;They&rsquo;re short, fun to write, and you can use strategic insights to bring lots of value to the table &mdash; even if you know nothing about Public Relations. I&rsquo;ll show you how.</p>
<p>Even showing clients you understand the strategy and psychology of writing a great press release gives you a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Check out this offer&nbsp;I received from a client after writing a proposal that included just ONE tip on how to write an awesome press release:</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171110-231627.png" src="NBImages/20171110-231627.png"/>

<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/uq1vm033lu8qkur/20171110-232000.png" src="NBImages/uq1vm033lu8qkur/20171110-232000.png" alt="" />
<p>The key is understanding that clients don&rsquo;t really care about press releases &mdash; what they want&nbsp;is PUBLICITY for their company (or their client&rsquo;s company).</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no magic button you can push to get a press release that reaches millions of people.</p>
<p>The trick is to write one that a journalist wants to publicize FOR you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you write a press release that grabs the attention of a reporter or editor at a major news site. With the click of a button, she can get your story&nbsp;in front of the masses &mdash; instantly.</p>
<p>Why would they&nbsp;do that? Because news sites &mdash; big and small &mdash; thrive by both creating and SHARING great content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more articles they publish, the more clicks they get. And the more clicks they get, the more they earn from advertising.</p>
<p>Does that mean you need dramatic stories that involve police chases, explosions, or fortunes changing hands?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not at all &mdash; newsworthy doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean drama.</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171110-232045.png" src="NBImages/20171110-232045.png" alt="" />

</figure>
<p>Remember, reporters are looking for great information. You just need to give them what they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Of course, just like all forms of copywriting, you need to keep the reader in mind when writing a press release. But you also need to get inside the head of a journalist, so you know how to write a press release they&rsquo;re eager to publicize.</p>
<p>THEY are the gatekeeper that decides if it sees the light of day! Their opinion is the one you care about most.</p>
<p>You already know they want good content to share. But what does &ldquo;good content&rdquo; mean to a journalist?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out&nbsp;my 3 rules below to find out.</p>

<h3><strong>3 Rules for writing press releases reporters love</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>RULE #1:&nbsp;Find the angle.</strong></h4>
<h4>Clients will come to you with all sorts of stories to turn into press releases.</h4>
<p>But it&rsquo;s up to you to position the story in a way that gets attention.</p>
<p>The more people your story appeals to, the more likely a reporter will be to share it.</p>
<p>Regurgitating a bunch of facts isn&rsquo;t going to cut it!</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you know how to find the right angle for your press release, even&nbsp;a mildly interesting story can be spun into a PR win.</p>
<p>Watch the video below for one of my favorite examples of how to find a great angle for your story.</p>
<div><video controls="controls" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="NBimages/FCCvideos/fcc-m3-position-your-story.mp4" type="video/mp4" /> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" /></video></div>


<p>You can use this approach with any story. For example, if a local business is opening a new retail location, how is it going to impact the Average Joe?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a sign of a local economy that&rsquo;s starting to boom?</li>
<li>Is it expected to create new jobs?</li>
<li>Will it make it easier for consumers to get things they need, while saving time and energy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see how all of those things are infinitely more compelling to readers of a local newspaper than the &ldquo;news&rdquo; that some company is expanding? Which, in turn, makes it more likely an editor will publish it.</p>
<h4><strong>RULE #2: Make it credible.</strong></h4>
<h4>Reporting the news is all about CREDIBILITY.</h4>
<p>If your press release is fluffy, hyped up, or skimpy on facts, it&rsquo;s going to end up in the trash.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean&nbsp;that all of your press releases need to be huge, &ldquo;official&rdquo; news about big companies or government agencies. There are lots of ways to add credibility to any press release (on any topic).</p>
<p>Here are my favorite quick and easy techniques anyone can use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add real names.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t just mention a company &mdash; talk about a real person at the company, like a manager or the CEO.</li>
<li>Use statistics and facts.&nbsp;These give your press release objectivity, instead of just being an &ldquo;opinion piece.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Quote people.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll show you how to get great quotes that make your press release more credible and more fun to read.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>RULE #3: Do the work for them.</strong></h4>
<h4>Ideally, a reporter would see your press release (either because the client emailed&nbsp;it to them, or placed it on a press release&nbsp;website where it caught their attention) and write an article about it.</h4>
<p>So it naturally follows that the less work they have to do to turn your press release into a published article, the more likely they are to want to do it.</p>
<p>For this reason, I like to&nbsp;do as much work as possible for reporters UP FRONT. That way, it&rsquo;s easy for them to turn my press release into actual NEWS.</p>
<p>In fact, my press releases are generally more like finished articles than a traditional &ldquo;bare bones&rdquo; announcement.</p>
<p>I still keep my press releases relatively short &mdash; usually about 1 page (300-500 words). But I do the work of finding the right angle and writing great copy so any reporter who&rsquo;s interested in it can publish it without putting too much thought into it.</p>
<p>The better&nbsp;you&rsquo;re able to do this, the more effective your press releases are going to be.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a real example of how I put all of these rules into action when writing a press release:</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171110-234554.png" src="NBImages/20171110-234554.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Notice how I:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Found an angle that appeals to as many people as possible. There are&nbsp;millions of credit union customers in the US, and all of them want better interest rates!</li>
<li>Used real names, quotes, and even&nbsp;facts and statistics to beef up credibility.</li>
<li>Wrote the press release as a mini-article, minimizing the amount of work a reporter would need to share it.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Before we dive in&hellip;</strong></h4>
<p>In a moment, we&rsquo;re going to get into the how-to of sitting down to write a winning press release.</p>
<p>But first, take a moment to learn how to avoid one of the biggest &ldquo;cardinal sins&rdquo; of press release copywriting. I&rsquo;ll explain more in the video below:</p>

<video controls="controls" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="NBimages/FCCvideos/FCC-M3-Salesy-press-releases.mp4" type="video/mp4" /> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" /></video>
<h3><strong>Preparing to write your press release</strong></h3>
<h3>Good research and preparation&nbsp;are important to all forms of copywriting &mdash; but they&rsquo;re even more key to press releases. That&rsquo;s because, even though press releases are short, they need to be packed with SUBSTANCE &mdash; never hype or opinions.</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start by looking for what reporters themselves are trained to look for: The&nbsp;&ldquo;who, <strong>what, when, where, why, and how.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Before you write a press release, ask yourself (and your client):</p>

<div class="content-box-fcc" style="margin-top:40px;">
<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:25px;"><strong>The 5 Ws</strong></h3>
<h4 style="margin-bottom:-10px; margin-top:27px;font-weight:500"><strong>WHAT</strong> is happening?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Is a new product being launched? Is an event taking place? Is a company hiring a new CFO, or expanding into a new location? Reporters have zero tolerance for vague information, so make sure to get with the client and find out EXACTLY what the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of your press release is going to be.</p>
<h4  style="margin-bottom:-10px; margin-top:27px;font-weight:500"><strong>WHO</strong> is involved?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Remember, don&rsquo;t just limit the &ldquo;who&rdquo; to the name of some faceless company. Mentioning real people makes your press release more concrete, more credible, and more interesting (readers relate to PEOPLE, not companies, events, or products).</p>
<h4  style="margin-bottom:-10px; margin-top:27px;font-weight:500"><strong>WHY</strong> is it happening? And why should anyone care?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Is it something interesting or surprising? Does it solve a problem or fill a particular need? Is it a local story that a smaller news site would love to share with its readers? Will it benefit people to know about it? Don&rsquo;t overlook this &mdash; the &ldquo;why&rdquo; can be one of the most important aspects of a great press release.</p>
<h4  style="margin-bottom:-10px; margin-top:27px;font-weight:500"><strong>WHERE</strong> is the story happening?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The &ldquo;where&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always relevant (or even applicable), but when it is, you must include it. Is it a regional story that&rsquo;s affecting a particular geographic area? Is a company event taking place at a specific location? Even online &ldquo;locations&rdquo; are important to mention whenever possible, especially if the goal of your press release is to push traffic to your client&rsquo;s website.</p>
<h4  style="margin-bottom:-10px; margin-top:27px;font-weight:500"><strong>WHEN</strong> is it happening?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>This can seem like a small detail, but when it comes to press releases, it&rsquo;s huge. Is it happening immediately? Did it happen yesterday? Will it take place next week? Remember, reporters are trained to look for this information, so don&rsquo;t overlook it or assume it&rsquo;ll be obvious &mdash; make sure you mention it explicitly.</p>
<h4  style="margin-bottom:-10px; margin-top:27px;font-weight:500"><strong>HOW</strong> is it being done?</h4>
<p >Like location, the &ldquo;how&rdquo; might not always apply. For example, if two businesses are merging, you might not want or need to go into the technical details of exactly how it&rsquo;s being done. But often, the &ldquo;how&rdquo; will be a key piece of information you&rsquo;ll want to include in your press releases. Remember to keep your Detective Hat on when getting information from the client. That way, when it&rsquo;s time to ask &ldquo;How?&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll know it and do it naturally.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>Gathering&nbsp;great quotes to spice things up</strong></h3>
<p>The best place to get great quotes for your press release is straight&nbsp;from your client. (Or your client&rsquo;s client, if your client is an agency or other &ldquo;middleman&rdquo; and not the direct subject of your press release.)</p>
<p>But you need to know how to get those golden nuggets&nbsp;out of them. They won&rsquo;t always know which points are most newsworthy and relevant, or even how to say things in an interesting and succinct way.</p>
<p>This is where you get to be the expert and coach them on what type of information to give you.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re writing about a new app that helps people stay healthy. Many business owners tend to focus on their product and it&rsquo;s features, because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s most interesting to THEM. That&rsquo;s OK, but it&rsquo;s also a good idea to get quotes on how the app will benefit users, how it differs from what&rsquo;s already out there, what impact the client hopes it will have on society, and anything else that can help you connect with a wide audience of people.</p>
<p>You can make this process even easier by writing a few great quotes FOR the client. Just make sure to get their explicit approval on each quote after you&rsquo;ve written it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea&nbsp;to get more quotes than you think you&rsquo;ll need. You don&rsquo;t have to use them all, and the more information you have, the easier it will be to write a great press release.</p>
<h3><strong>Sleuthing for newsworthy nuggets</strong></h3>
<p>Finding great statistics and research to add to your press releases doesn&rsquo;t have to be difficult or time consuming. I can usually do it in about&nbsp;5 minutes using Google.&nbsp;<strong>The key is knowing what to look for.</strong></p>
<p>For example, I once&nbsp;wrote a press release announcing&nbsp;a free webinar series to help small business owners succeed. Instead of just promoting the webinar, I knew it&rsquo;d be more powerful to highlight the unique challenges small business owners face, and then present the webinar as a solution to those challenges.</p>
<p>First, I searched for &ldquo;Small business statistics&rdquo;, and came up with a few interesting insights.</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-113509.png" src="NBImages/20171111-113509.png" alt="" />
<p>But I don&rsquo;t just look at the standard search results &mdash; I also click on the &ldquo;News&rdquo; tab to find even more juicy nuggets.</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-114056.png" src="NBImages/20171111-114056.png" alt="" />
<p>Within just a couple of minutes I had all of the following facts and figures copied into my notes:</p>

<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-114234.png" src="NBImages/20171111-114234.png" alt="" />
<figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Lots of juicy nuggets &mdash; all copy/pasted in just a few minutes</strong></figcaption>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to use all of the information you gather. Some of it won&rsquo;t be a great fit, and besides, facts like statistics should only be used as&nbsp;<em>supportive</em>&nbsp;information &mdash; you don&rsquo;t want to build your entire press release around them.</p>
<p>But just like with quotes, it&rsquo;s always good to get&nbsp;more facts/statistics than you&rsquo;re going to need. That way, you have plenty to choose from when you&rsquo;re sitting down to write.</p>
<p>In this case, I only used 2 of the &ldquo;golden nuggets&rdquo;&nbsp;I came up with, because they fit&nbsp;perfectly&nbsp;with the press release I was writing. You can see the finished press release&nbsp;below (I&rsquo;ve highlighted the stats I chose to include):</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-115259.png" src="NBImages/20171111-115259.png" alt="" />
<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Facts and figures are great &mdash; but don&rsquo;t overdo it</figcaption>
<p>Once you have all of your source material ready to go, it&rsquo;s time to sit down and write.</p>
<p>Step one is writing a great headline.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t need to be dramatic, but it does need to grab a reporter&rsquo;s attention &mdash; and fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They get tons of pitches every day! You only have about 0.5 seconds to make yours COUNT.&nbsp;And you need to do it in as few words as possible.</p>
<p>You can do this using something I call the &ldquo;4S Checklist&rdquo;. Y0ur headline should meet all of the following criteria (it&rsquo;s usually a good idea to write 2-3 headlines, then offer them all as options to the client):</p>

<div class="textbox5">
<h3><strong>My 4S Checklist&nbsp;for writing kickass press release headlines</strong></h3>
<h4>☑<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Substantive</strong></h4>
<p>Reporters are tough! Headlines that are fluffy, salesy or hyped up&nbsp;won&rsquo;t make the cut. Give them something solid that they can sink their teeth into.</p>
<h4>☑&nbsp;<strong>Straight to the point</strong></h4>
<p>DO NOT try to be clever. Eliminate all wordplay and traces of cuteness. They&rsquo;re reading too fast to get it, and even if they do they&rsquo;re too busy to appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>☑&nbsp;<strong>Specific</strong></h4>
<p>Use even a hint of vague language and any journalist will insta-delete your press release. Explain the point of the press release in concrete detail, avoiding all abstraction. (A good way to think of this is, &ldquo;Show, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;)</p>
<h4>☑&nbsp;<strong>Significant</strong></h4>
<p>This is the holy grail of press release headlines. Your headline must answer the question, &ldquo;WHO CARES?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p> Let&rsquo;s look at some REAL examples of good and bad headlines:</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-122420.png" src="NBImages/20171111-122420.png" alt="" />

<h3><strong>Following up with&nbsp;a strong opening (and beyond)</strong></h3>
<p>Next to your headline, the first few sentences are the most critical point in your press release.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; with something fluffy, build on the momentum of your strong headline and jump right into the main details of your story.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to find out more:</p>
<video controls="controls" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="NBimages/FCCvideos/FCC-M3-Burying-the-lead.mp4" type="video/mp4" /> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" /></video>
<p>Your opening line should be a summary of the main hook, perhaps adding in an additional detail or two. Remember to be specific and keep it interesting.</p>
<p>Your &ldquo;W&rsquo;s&rdquo; will come in handy here&hellip;adding a WHEN or WHY works wonders.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a good example from the sports world:</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-123750.png" src="NBImages/20171111-123750.png" alt="" />
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some more examples of good vs bad openings:</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-124348.png" src="NBImages/20171111-124348.png" alt="" />
<p>As you&nbsp;continue to write each additional paragraph of your press release, you have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can mention a new detail (usually one of the W&rsquo;s), or&hellip;</li>
<li>You can expand on one or more of the details you&rsquo;ve already&nbsp;written</li>
</ol>
<p>A good press release contains a mixture of both. You give a detail or two, then expand on the most important ones.</p>
<p>Then rinse and repeat until you&rsquo;ve covered all of the 5 W&rsquo;s &mdash; or at least the ones that apply to your story.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to go into exhaustive detail on each one. This is a short statement about the news &mdash; not a novella. Journalists aren&rsquo;t sales copywriters, and they have zero patience for wordiness.</p>
<p>Doing a Role Reversal exercise&nbsp;works wonders here: As you write your press release, think about it from the reader&rsquo;s perspective and ask yourself, &ldquo;What would my next question be?&rdquo; Then, answer it!</p>
<p>If you get stuck at any point, just go back to the 5 W&rsquo;s: who, what, when, where, why. Those are your north star, and they&rsquo;ll guide you throughout the process of writing a great press release.</p>
<p>You can also use these specific &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; to help propel your copy forward in case you get stuck:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beyond-the-client quotes.</strong>&nbsp;You already know you can get quotes from your client, but&nbsp;what if you need more? Quotes from your client&rsquo;s customers, or even public quotes from around the web can come in handy and help you move forward. (Just make sure to always use proper attribution.)</li>
<li><strong>Other news.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Are there other pieces of news you can tie your story to? Writing about how your story relates to a current event or hot-button topic can make things more exciting and relevant.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Link or Call To Action.</strong>&nbsp;Where should someone go if they want to take the next step or learn more about what you&rsquo;re promoting? A press release isn&rsquo;t the place to be spammy or salesy, but it&rsquo;s OK to include a&nbsp;helpful link for readers who want to go deeper. (It&rsquo;s also a great way to get more traffic to your client&rsquo;s site.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the body of the following press releases to see how I put these concepts into action:</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-130024.png" src="NBImages/20171111-130024.png" alt="" />
<p><strong>Next, let&rsquo;s take a look at a press release that could have done a better job with this.</strong></p>
<p>As you read through it, try and figure out where they might have improved. Then, when you&rsquo;re done, read my full analysis below (NO PEEKING until then)&hellip;</p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-130243.png" src="NBImages/20171111-130243.png" alt="" />
<h3><strong>My analysis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Weak headline</strong></p>
<p>The company name isn&rsquo;t well known, making it mostly irrelevant. And no one knows what a &ldquo;box-storage scanning initiative&rdquo; is.</p>
<p><strong>Too wordy!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Reporters (and readers) will be gone after half of the first sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Important W&rsquo;s are left out</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no mention of&nbsp;when&nbsp;or&nbsp;where&nbsp;anything is going to take place.</p>
<p><strong>Even the W&rsquo;s that are included aren&rsquo;t expanded upon very well</strong></p>
<p>For example, they try to explain the&nbsp;what, but leave out key details, like what the promotional pricing will be, who it&rsquo;s for, etc.</p>
<p><strong>The lead is buried</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only toward the end of the piece we find out (vaguely) that the company has a special offer to help businesses fire-proof their paper records by going digital.</p>
<p><strong>Unclear focus</strong></p>
<p>Hospitals, agencies, and businesses should be simplified down to ONE single focus that tells a &ldquo;story&rdquo; a reporter can quickly grasp.</p>
<p><strong>No call to action</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what readers should do to take advantage of the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how I might rewrite a press release like this:&nbsp;</strong><strong>⤵︎</strong></p>
<img data-featherlight-variant="long-image" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171111-130736.png" src="NBImages/20171111-130736.png" alt="" />
<p>It may be interesting to watch me rewrite a press release, but let&rsquo;s go further.</p>
<p>Go through the before and after versions in detail&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What specifically do you notice?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are some of the more subtle techniques I used to improve it?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a perfect rewrite, but you can start to see what the process of thinking like a reporter looks like and how to turn a boring press release into &nbsp;something newsworthy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting these changes can help you internalize the mindset of writing press releases designed to get publicity, and make clients extremely happy.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Module 3 recap</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>When you&rsquo;re writing a press release, your most important audience is reporters.</li>
<li>Finding an angle that appeals to a wide audience and doing the &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; work upfront makes it more likely your press release will get publicized.</li>
<li>Use real names, statistics and facts, and quotes to make your press release more credible and exciting.</li>
<li>Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;News&rdquo; tab is a great source for relevant info to support your copy. (Always make sure to attribute properly when including info from outside sources.)</li>
<li>The easiest way to get quotes is to write them for your client (or their customers) &mdash; just make sure to get them approved by the people you&rsquo;re quoting!</li>
<li>Never turn your press release into an advertisement for your client &mdash; it will do more harm than good.</li>
<li>A great press release headline is: Strong, straight to the point, specific, and significant to the journalist whose desk it lands on.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t bury the lead. Put your most important and exciting information right up front &mdash; preferably in the first couple of sentences.</li>
<li>Your press release is finished when you&rsquo;ve answered all of the relevant questions: Who, what, when, where, why, and how.</li>
