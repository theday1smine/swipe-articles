<div>Landing pages come in lots of different sizes, styles, and designs. Clients can hire you to write anything from a simple opt-in page to a longer, more in-depth page.</div>

<div>They might call it a “squeeze page”, “lead capture page”, “lander”, or even a “destination page”.</div>

<div>Don’t get hung up on any of these details. Regardless of the size, shape, or what you call it, the job of a landing page is to promote a specific offer.</div>

<div>And the goal of your landing page copy is to get as many people as possible to take that offer.</div>

<div>In this lesson, I’ll show you exactly how to do that — in any situation.</div>

<div>No matter what type of page you’re writing, the lessons you learn in this module will cover everything you need to create a high-converting page your clients will love.</div>


<h4>The first step to writing a great landing page </h4>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div>Unlike other forms of copywriting (e.g. email), landing page copy doesn’t just sit there on the page. It fits into a design scheme, like furniture fits into a house.</div>

<div>Understanding this allows you to write better copy, faster, with less effort.</div>

<div>For example, a client once asked me to write copy for a landing page asking people to sign up for a free service. What do you think my first question was?</div>

<div>Think about it for a moment before moving on.</div>

<div>Most people I pose this challenge to — even professional freelance copywriters — answer with something like, “Who is your target audience?”</div>

<div>But the real answer is: <strong> Do you have a particular design or template in mind for this landing page? </strong></div>

<div>At which point he showed me a design layout that looked like this:</div>

<p><img class="image22" src="NBImages/20180618-183315.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div>

<div>If I hadn’t asked this question, I’d have written the landing page flying blind. It would’ve been like trying to decorate a house, without knowing the square footage, or how many rooms it contained.</div>

<div>Instead, I was able to use the template as a blueprint to help me write the perfect amount of copy, and know exactly what to focus on — like a “paint by numbers” guide.</div>

<div>Here’s the exact copy I sent to the client. Notice how it corresponds exactly with the template he had picked out:</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="image22" src="NBImages/20180618-183513.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<div>The more you know about the physical layout of the page, the easier it will be to write great copy for it. In this case, I used the template as my “road map” — of course, I still had to write great copy, but it gave me a blueprint for exactly what to write, where.</div>

<div>Now let’s go a step deeper and talk about the strategy I used to write the copy for this page.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="textbox7">
<h2>Strategy Breakdown #1</h2>
<p>You already know the importance of understanding the reader’s story before you write a word of copy. But it’s even more critical to writing landing page copy, because the strategic decisions you’ll make often have just as much to do with how the reader <em> arrives </em> on the page as they do with the offer itself!</p>
<p>Watch the video below to find out more:</p>
<div><video controls="controls" width="450px" height="150">
				<source src="NBImages/FCCvideos/FCC-M6-1 How to think about landing pages_DOWN.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
				<source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
			</video></div>
<p>Here was the reader’s story in this case:</p>
<ol>
<li>They decided they wanted to buy a house</li>
<li>Next, they visited a real estate agent — but didn’t know their credit score or price range</li>
<li>The real estate agent sent them a link to this landing page where they could get a “Home Financing Certificate” that would show their ideal price range for a new home based on their credit history</li>
</ol>
<p>Thinking about the landing page as an <em> extension </em> of where they came from, I knew the copy we opened with should feel like a continuation of their conversation with their real estate agent.</p>
<p>But I also didn’t want it to sound too formal or “businesslike”. Can you figure out why? Take a moment to think about it before you keep reading.</p>
<p>It’s because buying a house is fun and exciting! Trying to hook them with words like “credit” or “home financing certificate” doesn’t sound like much fun, does it?</p>
<p>In fact, one of the first lines of copy I came up with for the page said that buying a home “should be exciting, not confusing.” (This type of “why” oriented copy connects with people on a deep emotional level.)</p>
<p>Once I had their attention, it was time to explain how it works. I did this for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The template the client had picked out for this landing page contained a step-by-step “How it works” section</li>
<li>Unless you’re offering something self-explanatory (e.g. an ebook), it’s usually a good idea to explain how it works</li>
</ol>
<p>But notice that I didn’t just explain how it works in a cold, technical fashion.</p>
<p>I also explained what was in it for THEM (for example, a quicker approval process). People are always wondering, “What’s in it for ME?” — the better you answer that question throughout your landing page copy, the more successful it’ll be.</p>
<p>Next, I included a testimonial — again, this was part of the landing page template the client had chosen, but I always try to use testimonials on landing pages whenever possible. (You can get these right from the client, or you can charge them extra to interview their customers, as you learned in Module 1.)</p>
<p>The landing page template the client had chosen also contained some additional space at the bottom to mention (and briefly discuss) more features and benefits. I’d already loaded up the copy with plenty of these already, but this was a great place to mention an ancillary feature (free credit monitoring) that didn’t make sense to discuss earlier on the page.</p>
<p>I also used this space to reiterate that the offer was free, since it never hurts to mention key words like “free” multiple times.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the copy, I decided to “overcome objections.” After my initial conversation with the client (and doing my own mental Role Reversal exercise), I knew the reader would likely have questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How do I know this is legit?”</li>
<li>And: “Will it hurt my credit score?”</li>
</ul>
<p>So I made sure to devote a few lines of copy to addressing those concerns.</p>
<p>Had this landing page been aimed at “cold” traffic — rather than readers who’d be warmed up by their relationship with their real estate agent — I may have tried to overcome one or more of these objections even earlier, possibly even in the headline.</p>
<p>I also probably would have made the headline longer, explaining the offer in a bit more detail. But since visitors were sent here by a real estate professional, none of that was necessary.</p>
<p>One more thing you may have noticed is how authentic the copy feels. In fact, it almost seems as though I have an intimate knowledge of what it means to get a home financing certificate from this company — even though I’d never heard of anything like this before the client asked me to write the page.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to find out how I pull this off:</p>
<p> </p>
<div><video controls="controls" width="450px" height="150">
				<source src="NBImages/FCCvideos/FCC-M6-2Psychology of landing pages1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
				<source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
			</video></div>
</div>
<br />

<div>Will this same strategy work for every landing page you write? Of course not. You need to put your Detective Hat on and always be looking for the best approach for each situation.</div>

<div>Let’s look at an example of how I tackled a landing page in a completely different situation:</div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="image22" src="NBImages/20180618-194041.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At first glance, you’ll notice that this page contains:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>More copy</li>
<li>More Call To Action buttons &amp; testimonials</li>
<li>And a more formal tone</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are some good reasons for that! Read the case study below for a deep dive into the exact strategies I used to write the copy for this page.</p>
<br /> <br />
<div class="textbox7">
<h2>Strategy breakdown #2</h2>
<p>While the target audience for the previous landing page was homebuyers, this page targeted lawyers. And not just any lawyers — these would be attorneys looking for expert witnesses they could put on the witness stand to testify in court.</p>
<p>And unlike the previous page, the traffic arriving at this page was completely <strong> cold </strong> . The reader probably searched Google for a phrase like “expert witness”, and had little-to-no knowledge about the offer they were about to see.</p>
<p>In other words, they’d be less familiar with what we were offering — while also being more skeptical.</p>
<p>This meant we’d need to do more explaining and more convincing — hence the longer page with more information to help them make a decision.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another key decision that differed from the previous example: The tone of the copy.</p>
<p>While buying a home is fun and exciting, hiring an expert witness to testify in court is serious business. In fact, while I sometimes discourage clients from being overly formal, in this case I specifically asked the client for a few technical terms we could throw around in order to build trust and credibility with this “hardcore” audience.</p>
<p>Let’s move on and talk about the copy itself.</p>
<p>At first glance, it might seem like the right way to tackle a page like this would be to focus on the benefits of finding a great expert witness (for example, winning more trials).</p>
<p>But when the client filled me in on the reader’s story, I started to realize it shouldn’t be the #1 focus of the page.</p>
<p>He explained that lawyers already understand the enormous value of using expert witnesses in court. Their big problem is FINDING one.</p>
<p>As the client explained to me, the right expert witness needs to have lots of specialized qualities — including the right credentials, previous experience testifying in court, and more. This makes it extremely difficult to find the right expert witness, especially on a tight timeline.</p>
<p>And the few services that have historically tried to solve this problem didn’t do it very well. So lawyers were used to being burned — paying too much for questionable “experts” from fast talking online marketers.</p>
<p>In order to convert as many readers as possible, I knew my top priority would be to show them that the service was reliable and trustworthy, and would deliver exactly what they need.</p>
<p>One framework I use in this type of situation is to ask the client, “If I were the reader, what are all of the things that might PREVENT me from signing up for this service?” Then I make sure we address each and every one of those things in the copy.</p>
<p>In other words, I treat the copy as a way to overcome every conceivable objection. Which is exactly what I did here. For example, the client explained to me that lawyers who use their competitors’ services end up getting billed twice — once from the service, and once from the witness. Once I knew that, overcoming this objection was as easy as saying “You’ll only receive 1 bill from us — period.”</p>
<p>Another subtle concern the client pointed out to me was the fact that lawyers are often in a rush, and need to find an expert witness quickly. They’re worried about wasting valuable time on a “wild goose chase.” So I made it a special point to mention that we’d respond to them quickly after they requested their quote.</p>
<p>There are tons of other great nuggets I got from the client — all of which I never would have been able to come up with on my own. These are the type of details that will help you take your copy from “OK” to “awesome.”</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div>Later in this week’s lesson, we’ll go into even more detail about the specific techniques I used to write the copy for this page.</div>

<div>For now, let’s analyze a totally different landing page I wrote — this one doubling as a Home Page for a therapist’s website:</div>
</div>

<div><img class="image22" src="NBImages/20180618-200011.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<br />
<div class="textbox7">
<h2><strong> Strategy breakdown #3 </strong></h2>
<p>These days, many businesses and professionals use landing pages as their website’s “home page” as a way to increase leads and sales, while giving their website a cleaner look.</p>
<p>While all landing pages contain some of the same elements — like headline, bullets, call to action — you can see that this one is quite different from the previous two examples I’ve shown you.</p>
<p>For one thing, it’s much shorter than the “expert witness” page we just looked at. Why do you suppose that is? The answer might surprise you…</p>
<p>The reason I kept this page short is because no matter how hard I pressed, the client did not give me as much information as I would have liked. And that’s OK! It’s just one of the realities of being a freelance copywriter.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re a writer, not a magician. The client was still perfectly happy with the copy, and even turned into a repeat customer.</p>
<p>Another thing you may notice is that this page starts off with a few longer paragraphs of copy.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>As the client explained to me, readers arriving at this page are struggling with life and are often in a lot of pain.</p>
<p>They’re looking not just for a “solution,” but for a human being who understands them.</p>
<p>If readers arrive and see a lot of sections filled with bullet points and one-liners, they wouldn’t feel that human touch you’d expect to find on a page like this.</p>
<p>In other words, this page wasn’t as much about “selling” as it was a personal message from a therapist to the people who needed her help.</p>
<p>I needed to make them feel like a real person was speaking to them, so I created longer paragraphs that are personal, conversational and human.</p>
<p>Similarly, you may have noticed that in the earlier example, the first call-to-action button is in the header directly beneath the headline. That makes sense for a “strictly business” type of service where many people will be ready to take the next step very quickly. But in this case, it would have been tacky and insensitive to move people to the appointment too quickly.</p>
<p>This is yet another reason why I’m not fond of “formulas” when it comes to writing great landing page copy. Yes, there are certain elements that every landing page will contain — and we’ll discuss these in more detail shortly.</p>
<p>But never lose sight of the fact that each project has its own unique variables and goals. That’s how you move from being “just a writer” to a top professional clients love doing business with, over and over again.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div>As you can see, when it comes to landing page copy, there is no perfect “one size fits all” strategy. The key is to look at the specific offer, as well as the reader’s story, and think STRATEGICALLY.</div>

<div>It’s also a good idea to (briefly) explain your strategy to the client. Clients love this because it gives them context for the copywriting decisions and techniques you’re using.</div>

<div>There’s no need to go overboard — a few bullet points of explanation can be a great way to warm them up and ensure they love the copy you’ve written for them.</div>
</div>

<h2><strong> The “heart and soul” of your landing page </strong></h2>
<div>
<div>If strategy is the engine that drives your landing page copy, amazing bullet points are the lifeblood that flows through it.</div>

<div>There are three different levels of bullet points you can choose from:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>One-line “zinger” bullets</li>
<li>Expanded bullets</li>
<li>“Supercharged” mini-section bullets</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Depending on the landing page you’re writing, you may choose to use one, two, or even a combination of all three.</div>

<div>Let’s go over each one in more detail:</div>
</div>


<div>
<h3><strong> 1) One-line “zinger” bullets </strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>These work best when you want to describe something that’s straightforward and direct. There are a few different ways you can use one-line “zinger” bullets, depending on the situation.</div>

<div>For example, you can use bullets to create curiosity. This works great for information-related offers, like webinars or ebooks. Here’s an example of the curiosity-building bullets on our FTW landing page offering my 5 Upwork hacks:</div>

</div>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200542.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>To write these bullets, I went through each email hack and asked myself two questions:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>“If I were reading these for the first time, which parts would I find most surprising?”</li>
<li>“How can I make these sound as cool as possible?” (e.g. “Scientifically proven”, “Raise my rates by $50/hr overnight”, “Takes just 3 minutes to execute”)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>Then I described what the hack can help you accomplish, without mentioning the actual hack. BOOM! A short, irresistible set of bullets that makes it practically impossible to not sign up.</div>

<div><strong> You can also use one-line “zinger” bullets to highlight straightforward features, like this: </strong></div>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200712.png" alt="" /></div>
<p> </p>
<div><strong> Or even to simply highlight the BENEFITS of an offer. </strong></div>

<div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200742.png" alt="" /></div>

</div>
<div>
<div>When I write “benefit-driven” bullets, the question I ask myself is not “What will they get out of this product?”, but rather “What will they NOT get if they DON’T have this product?” This taps into their FOMO (“fear of missing out”), which is one of the most powerful psychological forces you can use.</div>

<div><strong> Another great use for one-line “zinger” bullets is to call out specific readers by explaining exactly who an offer is for: </strong></div>
</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200833.png" alt="" /></div>

<div><strong> You can also call out specific readers by their DESIRES. This works great when you don’t have specific information, such as their profession, geographic location, gender, age, etc. </strong></div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200908.png" alt="" /></div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200931.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>In the example above, I didn’t need to come up with any of these bullets on my own. They came directly from the client, who gave me a list of lessons that were covered in his information product. All I needed to do was choose the lessons that were most exciting, and tweak them into bullets that “zing”.</div>

<h3><strong> 2) Expanded bullets </strong></h3>
<div>These contain more copy than “zingers” and are usually preceded by a short title. They’re my “go-to” bullets when I need to convey detailed information, and a one-liner just won’t cut it.</div>

<div>For example, if you want to persuade readers to buy an ebook, it’s more powerful to spell out the contents of each chapter, rather than just mentioning the benefits.</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>You can also use expanded bullets to persuade readers to do something that asks them to make a commitment, such as:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Signing up for a free trial</li>
<li>Ordering a monthly subscription</li>
<li>Scheduling an appointment</li>
<li>Or requesting a demo</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Or you can use them to break down and simplify ideas that are technical or confusing, like business services and software products.</div>

<div>
<div><strong> Examples: </strong></div>

</div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201335.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Expanded bullets are a great way to describe health products and supplements, when you want to highlight the benefits of each individual ingredient:</div>

</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201604.png" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<div>
<h3><strong> 3) Supercharged “mini-section” bullets </strong></h3>

<div>Mini-section bullets are more of a paragraph than a bullet, and they are usually “roped off” into their own section on the page. Most mini-section bullets begin with a subheadline.</div>
</div>


<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201730.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<div>
<div>Supercharged mini-section bullets are a great way to pack in a lot of information, while keeping the page neat and “clean”.</div>

<div>For example, if your landing page is promoting a financial advisory firm that offers a variety of services, you can use mini-section bullets to show readers a “snapshot” of each service.</div>

<div><strong> Example: </strong></div>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201827.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<h2><strong> Getting readers to “pull the trigger” </strong></h2>
<div>It may be tempting to think that once your copy has done its job persuading the reader, the rest is just logistics.</div>

<div>But the reality is, landing page readers are not committed until they’ve “pulled the trigger”. Any snag in the process can give readers second thoughts, which can lead to fewer conversions.</div>

<div>For this reason, your call-to-action needs to be strategically crafted to get readers to cross the finish line.</div>

<div>I always make sure to tell clients that calls-to-action that have fewer fields to fill out are scientifically proven to get more signups.</div>

<div>Asking for less information doesn’t just make the process simpler. When readers see you asking for too much personal information (eg. address, phone number), their “antennas” kick into high gear, and they get ambivalent about the offer.</div>

<div>On our FTW opt-in pages, we only ask for 2 pieces of information:</div>
</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201918.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Some landing pages have just one field for the email address:</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201946.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Now let’s discuss how to write the call-to-action copy itself.</div>

<div>Most call-to-action sections have 2 copy areas:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>The call-to-action headline</li>
<li>The call-to-action button</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>The headline is not supposed to introduce any new information. It’s job is to give readers a final emotional “push” across the finish line. It should be short and exciting, and specify the action you want readers to take. You can use this area to summarize the offer, highlight a key benefit, or remind the reader the offer is free.</div>

<div>
<div><strong> Examples: </strong></div>

</div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-202120.png" alt="" /></div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-202524.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Your call-to-action button should be as specific as possible. Rather than saying “Buy now” or “Order today”, try to mention the specific product, or highlight a benefit the reader can expect.</div>

<div>There are many ways to do this, and the more creative you get, the happier your client will be.</div>

<div>Here are some examples of creative call-to-action buttons:</div>
</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-202704.png" alt="" /></div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-202720.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Here are some more tips for writing call-to-action buttons that stand out and get clicks:</div>

<div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Show readers it’s fast and easy: “Get a quote in less than 5 minutes”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Write it from the reader’s perspective: “Raise my IQ”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add urgency: “Join now — space is limited”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong> Writing an enticing headline — in under 10 minutes </strong></h2>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div>
<div>A lot of copywriters spend a long time coming up with their landing page headline. It never takes me more than a few minutes to come up with several powerful headlines.</div>

<div>Here are the 3 steps I use to come up with multiple headlines for any landing page:</div>
</div>


<div>
<h3><strong> 1) Copy and paste </strong></h3>
<div>My “first line of defense” with headline writing is to see if it’s already written. After you’ve written the copy, you can often one or even multiple lines that can be used as your headline — either “as is”, or with a bit of tweaking. It may be a bullet, subhead, or any other part of the page.</div>

<div>Before I write a headline from scratch, I go down the page looking for any line that has the potential to be a headline. Then I see how it looks, and if needed, I tweak it. Presto — I’ve got an instant headline.</div>

<div>Here’s an example of a line I originally placed near the bottom of a piece of landing page copy — promoting the service of a high-end logo designer — which ended up being my headline:</div>

<div><strong> “This Is One Of The Most Powerful — Yet Underrated — Marketing Tools In Your Arsenal” </strong></div>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div class="textbox7 textyblack">
<h2><strong> The headline I wrote in 10 seconds </strong></h2>
<p>I was once hired to write a landing page for a company that produced state-of-the-art hearing aids.</p>
<p>My client explained that the number one benefit his hearing aid offered was that the sound was super clear and lifelike, while his competitors’ hearing aids sounded metallic and distorted. His product imitated the human ear so closely, it amplified the sounds people wanted to hear, and filtered out background noise, solving one of the biggest problems faced by people who are hearing-impaired.</p>
<p>Because many companies make similar promises (eg. “sounds lifelike”), but don’t deliver, I needed a headline that conveyed that this life-changing product was the next best thing to having a fully-operational human ear.</p>
<p>I came up with several options that were “OK”, before I noticed a line buried in my own landing page copy —</p>
<p>” <strong> <em> Our hearing aids ask themselves ‘What would an ear do?’…and they do the EXACT same thing!” </em> </strong></p>
<p>I instantly realized that my headline had been staring me in the face! The client loved it, and told me that he was so excited, he wouldn’t be able to sleep that night.</p>

<p>Press releases are one of my favorite types of copywriting.&nbsp;They&rsquo;re short, fun to write, and you can use strategic insights to bring lots of value to the table &mdash; even if you know nothing about Public Relations. I&rsquo;ll show you how.</p>
<p>Even showing clients you understand the strategy and psychology of writing a great press release gives you a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Check out this offer&nbsp;I received from a client after writing a proposal that included just ONE tip on how to write an awesome press release:</p>

<p>The key is understanding that clients don&rsquo;t really care about press releases &mdash; what they want&nbsp;is PUBLICITY for their company (or their client&rsquo;s company).</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no magic button you can push to get a press release that reaches millions of people.</p>
<p>The trick is to write one that a journalist wants to publicize FOR you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you write a press release that grabs the attention of a reporter or editor at a major news site. With the click of a button, she can get your story&nbsp;in front of the masses &mdash; instantly.</p>
<p>Why would they&nbsp;do that? Because news sites &mdash; big and small &mdash; thrive by both creating and SHARING great content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more articles they publish, the more clicks they get. And the more clicks they get, the more they earn from advertising.</p>
<p>Does that mean you need dramatic stories that involve police chases, explosions, or fortunes changing hands?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not at all &mdash; newsworthy doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean drama.</p>

</figure>
<p>Remember, reporters are looking for great information. You just need to give them what they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Of course, just like all forms of copywriting, you need to keep the reader in mind when writing a press release. But you also need to get inside the head of a journalist, so you know how to write a press release they&rsquo;re eager to publicize.</p>
<p>THEY are the gatekeeper that decides if it sees the light of day! Their opinion is the one you care about most.</p>
<p>You already know they want good content to share. But what does &ldquo;good content&rdquo; mean to a journalist?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out&nbsp;my 3 rules below to find out.</p>

<h3><strong>3 Rules for writing press releases reporters love</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>RULE #1:&nbsp;Find the angle.</strong></h4>
<h4>Clients will come to you with all sorts of stories to turn into press releases.</h4>
<p>But it&rsquo;s up to you to position the story in a way that gets attention.</p>
<p>The more people your story appeals to, the more likely a reporter will be to share it.</p>
<p>Regurgitating a bunch of facts isn&rsquo;t going to cut it!</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you know how to find the right angle for your press release, even&nbsp;a mildly interesting story can be spun into a PR win.</p>
<p>Watch the video below for one of my favorite examples of how to find a great angle for your story.</p>
<div><video controls="controls" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/92zcw8cdnsm5gd2/FCC-M3%20Position%20your%20story.mp4?raw=1" type="video/mp4" /> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" /></video></div>

<div>
<p>You can use this approach with any story. For example, if a local business is opening a new retail location, how is it going to impact the Average Joe?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a sign of a local economy that&rsquo;s starting to boom?</li>
<li>Is it expected to create new jobs?</li>
<li>Will it make it easier for consumers to get things they need, while saving time and energy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see how all of those things are infinitely more compelling to readers of a local newspaper than the &ldquo;news&rdquo; that some company is expanding? Which, in turn, makes it more likely an editor will publish it.</p>
<h4><strong>RULE #2: Make it credible.</strong></h4>
<h4>Reporting the news is all about CREDIBILITY.</h4>
<p>If your press release is fluffy, hyped up, or skimpy on facts, it&rsquo;s going to end up in the trash.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean&nbsp;that all of your press releases need to be huge, &ldquo;official&rdquo; news about big companies or government agencies. There are lots of ways to add credibility to any press release (on any topic).</p>
<p>Here are my favorite quick and easy techniques anyone can use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add real names.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t just mention a company &mdash; talk about a real person at the company, like a manager or the CEO.</li>
<li>Use statistics and facts.&nbsp;These give your press release objectivity, instead of just being an &ldquo;opinion piece.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Quote people.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll show you how to get great quotes that make your press release more credible and more fun to read.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>RULE #3: Do the work for them.</strong></h4>
<h4>Ideally, a reporter would see your press release (either because the client emailed&nbsp;it to them, or placed it on a press release&nbsp;website where it caught their attention) and write an article about it.</h4>
<p>So it naturally follows that the less work they have to do to turn your press release into a published article, the more likely they are to want to do it.</p>
<p>For this reason, I like to&nbsp;do as much work as possible for reporters UP FRONT. That way, it&rsquo;s easy for them to turn my press release into actual NEWS.</p>
<p>In fact, my press releases are generally more like finished articles than a traditional &ldquo;bare bones&rdquo; announcement.</p>
<p>I still keep my press releases relatively short &mdash; usually about 1 page (300-500 words). But I do the work of finding the right angle and writing great copy so any reporter who&rsquo;s interested in it can publish it without putting too much thought into it.</p>
<p>The better&nbsp;you&rsquo;re able to do this, the more effective your press releases are going to be.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a real example of how I put all of these rules into action when writing a press release:</p>
</div>
<br /> <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/5mvgx5kzn51g8hg/20171110-234554.png?raw=1" alt="" />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Notice how I:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Found an angle that appeals to as many people as possible. There are&nbsp;millions of credit union customers in the US, and all of them want better interest rates!</li>
<li>Used real names, quotes, and even&nbsp;facts and statistics to beef up credibility.</li>
<li>Wrote the press release as a mini-article, minimizing the amount of work a reporter would need to share it.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Before we dive in&hellip;</strong></h4>
<p>In a moment, we&rsquo;re going to get into the how-to of sitting down to write a winning press release.</p>
<p>But first, take a moment to learn how to avoid one of the biggest &ldquo;cardinal sins&rdquo; of press release copywriting. I&rsquo;ll explain more in the video below:</p>
</div>
<br />
<div><video controls="controls" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xos7l513fytzwzs/FCC-M3%20Salesy%20press%20releases.mp4?raw=1" type="video/mp4" /> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" /></video></div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Preparing to write your press release</strong></h3>
<h3>Good research and preparation&nbsp;are important to all forms of copywriting &mdash; but they&rsquo;re even more key to press releases. That&rsquo;s because, even though press releases are short, they need to be packed with SUBSTANCE &mdash; never hype or opinions.</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start by looking for what reporters themselves are trained to look for: The&nbsp;&ldquo;who, <strong>what, when, where, why, and how.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Before you write a press release, ask yourself (and your client):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div >
<div class="content-box-fcc">
<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:10px;"><strong>The 5 Ws</strong></h3>
<div class="">
<h4><strong>WHAT</strong> is happening?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Is a new product being launched? Is an event taking place? Is a company hiring a new CFO, or expanding into a new location? Reporters have zero tolerance for vague information, so make sure to get with the client and find out EXACTLY what the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of your press release is going to be.</p>
<h4><strong>WHO</strong> is involved?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Remember, don&rsquo;t just limit the &ldquo;who&rdquo; to the name of some faceless company. Mentioning real people makes your press release more concrete, more credible, and more interesting (readers relate to PEOPLE, not companies, events, or products).</p>
<h4><strong>WHY</strong> is it happening? And why should anyone care?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Is it something interesting or surprising? Does it solve a problem or fill a particular need? Is it a local story that a smaller news site would love to share with its readers? Will it benefit people to know about it? Don&rsquo;t overlook this &mdash; the &ldquo;why&rdquo; can be one of the most important aspects of a great press release.</p>
<h4><strong>WHERE</strong> is the story happening?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The &ldquo;where&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always relevant (or even applicable), but when it is, you must include it. Is it a regional story that&rsquo;s affecting a particular geographic area? Is a company event taking place at a specific location? Even online &ldquo;locations&rdquo; are important to mention whenever possible, especially if the goal of your press release is to push traffic to your client&rsquo;s website.</p>
<h4><strong>WHEN</strong> is it happening?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>This can seem like a small detail, but when it comes to press releases, it&rsquo;s huge. Is it happening immediately? Did it happen yesterday? Will it take place next week? Remember, reporters are trained to look for this information, so don&rsquo;t overlook it or assume it&rsquo;ll be obvious &mdash; make sure you mention it explicitly.</p>
<h4><strong>HOW</strong> is it being done?</h4>
<p>Like location, the &ldquo;how&rdquo; might not always apply. For example, if two businesses are merging, you might not want or need to go into the technical details of exactly how it&rsquo;s being done. But often, the &ldquo;how&rdquo; will be a key piece of information you&rsquo;ll want to include in your press releases. Remember to keep your Detective Hat on when getting information from the client. That way, when it&rsquo;s time to ask &ldquo;How?&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll know it and do it naturally.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Gathering&nbsp;great quotes to spice things up</strong></h3>
<p>The best place to get great quotes for your press release is straight&nbsp;from your client. (Or your client&rsquo;s client, if your client is an agency or other &ldquo;middleman&rdquo; and not the direct subject of your press release.)</p>
<p>But you need to know how to get those golden nuggets&nbsp;out of them. They won&rsquo;t always know which points are most newsworthy and relevant, or even how to say things in an interesting and succinct way.</p>
<p>This is where you get to be the expert and coach them on what type of information to give you.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re writing about a new app that helps people stay healthy. Many business owners tend to focus on their product and it&rsquo;s features, because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s most interesting to THEM. That&rsquo;s OK, but it&rsquo;s also a good idea to get quotes on how the app will benefit users, how it differs from what&rsquo;s already out there, what impact the client hopes it will have on society, and anything else that can help you connect with a wide audience of people.</p>
<p>You can make this process even easier by writing a few great quotes FOR the client. Just make sure to get their explicit approval on each quote after you&rsquo;ve written it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea&nbsp;to get more quotes than you think you&rsquo;ll need. You don&rsquo;t have to use them all, and the more information you have, the easier it will be to write a great press release.</p>
<h3><strong>Sleuthing for newsworthy nuggets</strong></h3>
<p>Finding great statistics and research to add to your press releases doesn&rsquo;t have to be difficult or time consuming. I can usually do it in about&nbsp;5 minutes using Google.&nbsp;<strong>The key is knowing what to look for.</strong></p>
<p>For example, I once&nbsp;wrote a press release announcing&nbsp;a free webinar series to help small business owners succeed. Instead of just promoting the webinar, I knew it&rsquo;d be more powerful to highlight the unique challenges small business owners face, and then present the webinar as a solution to those challenges.</p>
<p>First, I searched for &ldquo;Small business statistics&rdquo;, and came up with a few interesting insights.</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/19r1bsg5dtgblqy/20171111-113509.png?raw=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t just look at the standard search results &mdash; I also click on the &ldquo;News&rdquo; tab to find even more juicy nuggets.</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2gkzf9mv7x5phpj/20171111-114056.png?raw=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>Within just a couple of minutes I had all of the following facts and figures copied into my notes:</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/vsvifvfu5i3guzs/20171111-114234.png?raw=1" alt="" /></div>
<div>
<figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Lots of juicy nuggets &mdash; all copy/pasted in just a few minutes</strong></figcaption>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to use all of the information you gather. Some of it won&rsquo;t be a great fit, and besides, facts like statistics should only be used as&nbsp;<em>supportive</em>&nbsp;information &mdash; you don&rsquo;t want to build your entire press release around them.</p>
<p>But just like with quotes, it&rsquo;s always good to get&nbsp;more facts/statistics than you&rsquo;re going to need. That way, you have plenty to choose from when you&rsquo;re sitting down to write.</p>
<p>In this case, I only used 2 of the &ldquo;golden nuggets&rdquo;&nbsp;I came up with, because they fit&nbsp;perfectly&nbsp;with the press release I was writing. You can see the finished press release&nbsp;below (I&rsquo;ve highlighted the stats I chose to include):</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/d1jofpo595zet7q/20171111-115259.png?raw=1" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<div>
<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Facts and figures are great &mdash; but don&rsquo;t overdo it</figcaption>
<p>Once you have all of your source material ready to go, it&rsquo;s time to sit down and write.</p>
<p>Step one is writing a great headline.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t need to be dramatic, but it does need to grab a reporter&rsquo;s attention &mdash; and fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They get tons of pitches every day! You only have about 0.5 seconds to make yours COUNT.&nbsp;And you need to do it in as few words as possible.</p>
<p>You can do this using something I call the &ldquo;4S Checklist&rdquo;. Y0ur headline should meet all of the following criteria (it&rsquo;s usually a good idea to write 2-3 headlines, then offer them all as options to the client):</p>
</div>

<div class="textbox5">
<h3><strong>My 4S Checklist&nbsp;for writing kickass press release headlines</strong></h3>
<h4>☑<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Substantive</strong></h4>
<p>Reporters are tough! Headlines that are fluffy, salesy or hyped up&nbsp;won&rsquo;t make the cut. Give them something solid that they can sink their teeth into.</p>
<h4>☑&nbsp;<strong>Straight to the point</strong></h4>
<p>DO NOT try to be clever. Eliminate all wordplay and traces of cuteness. They&rsquo;re reading too fast to get it, and even if they do they&rsquo;re too busy to appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>☑&nbsp;<strong>Specific</strong></h4>
<p>Use even a hint of vague language and any journalist will insta-delete your press release. Explain the point of the press release in concrete detail, avoiding all abstraction. (A good way to think of this is, &ldquo;Show, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;)</p>
<h4>☑&nbsp;<strong>Significant</strong></h4>
<p>This is the holy grail of press release headlines. Your headline must answer the question, &ldquo;WHO CARES?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p> Let&rsquo;s look at some REAL examples of good and bad headlines:</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xifi5mbd5y9c4gg/20171111-122420.png?raw=1" alt="" /></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Following up with&nbsp;a strong opening (and beyond)</strong></h3>
<p>Next to your headline, the first few sentences are the most critical point in your press release.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; with something fluffy, build on the momentum of your strong headline and jump right into the main details of your story.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to find out more:</p>
<div><video controls="controls" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/emlfwkkcptspxwq/FCC-M3%20Burying%20the%20lead.mp4?raw=1" type="video/mp4" /> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" /></video></div>
</div>
<p>Your opening line should be a summary of the main hook, perhaps adding in an additional detail or two. Remember to be specific and keep it interesting.</p>
<p>Your &ldquo;W&rsquo;s&rdquo; will come in handy here&hellip;adding a WHEN or WHY works wonders.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a good example from the sports world:</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4cez33pl2ybwqjp/20171111-123750.png?raw=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some more examples of good vs bad openings:</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/369qaqcif02y6ts/20171111-124348.png?raw=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>As you&nbsp;continue to write each additional paragraph of your press release, you have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can mention a new detail (usually one of the W&rsquo;s), or&hellip;</li>
<li>You can expand on one or more of the details you&rsquo;ve already&nbsp;written</li>
</ol>
<p>A good press release contains a mixture of both. You give a detail or two, then expand on the most important ones.</p>
<p>Then rinse and repeat until you&rsquo;ve covered all of the 5 W&rsquo;s &mdash; or at least the ones that apply to your story.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to go into exhaustive detail on each one. This is a short statement about the news &mdash; not a novella. Journalists aren&rsquo;t sales copywriters, and they have zero patience for wordiness.</p>
<p>Doing a Role Reversal exercise&nbsp;works wonders here: As you write your press release, think about it from the reader&rsquo;s perspective and ask yourself, &ldquo;What would my next question be?&rdquo; Then, answer it!</p>
<p>If you get stuck at any point, just go back to the 5 W&rsquo;s: who, what, when, where, why. Those are your north star, and they&rsquo;ll guide you throughout the process of writing a great press release.</p>
<p>You can also use these specific &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; to help propel your copy forward in case you get stuck:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beyond-the-client quotes.</strong>&nbsp;You already know you can get quotes from your client, but&nbsp;what if you need more? Quotes from your client&rsquo;s customers, or even public quotes from around the web can come in handy and help you move forward. (Just make sure to always use proper attribution.)</li>
<li><strong>Other news.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Are there other pieces of news you can tie your story to? Writing about how your story relates to a current event or hot-button topic can make things more exciting and relevant.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Link or Call To Action.</strong>&nbsp;Where should someone go if they want to take the next step or learn more about what you&rsquo;re promoting? A press release isn&rsquo;t the place to be spammy or salesy, but it&rsquo;s OK to include a&nbsp;helpful link for readers who want to go deeper. (It&rsquo;s also a great way to get more traffic to your client&rsquo;s site.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the body of the following press releases to see how I put these concepts into action:</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4w9nc6g4rn4lno9/20171111-130024.png?raw=1" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Next, let&rsquo;s take a look at a press release that could have done a better job with this.</strong></p>
<p>As you read through it, try and figure out where they might have improved. Then, when you&rsquo;re done, read my full analysis below (NO PEEKING until then)&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/5y19weafnws8zqv/20171111-130243.png?raw=1" alt="" /></p>
<h3><strong>My analysis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Weak headline</strong></p>
<p>The company name isn&rsquo;t well known, making it mostly irrelevant. And no one knows what a &ldquo;box-storage scanning initiative&rdquo; is.</p>
<p><strong>Too wordy!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Reporters (and readers) will be gone after half of the first sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Important W&rsquo;s are left out</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no mention of&nbsp;when&nbsp;or&nbsp;where&nbsp;anything is going to take place.</p>
<p><strong>Even the W&rsquo;s that are included aren&rsquo;t expanded upon very well</strong></p>
<p>For example, they try to explain the&nbsp;what, but leave out key details, like what the promotional pricing will be, who it&rsquo;s for, etc.</p>
<p><strong>The lead is buried</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only toward the end of the piece we find out (vaguely) that the company has a special offer to help businesses fire-proof their paper records by going digital.</p>
<p><strong>Unclear focus</strong></p>
<p>Hospitals, agencies, and businesses should be simplified down to ONE single focus that tells a &ldquo;story&rdquo; a reporter can quickly grasp.</p>
<p><strong>No call to action</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what readers should do to take advantage of the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how I might rewrite a press release like this:&nbsp;</strong><strong>⤵︎</strong></p>

<p>It may be interesting to watch me rewrite a press release, but let&rsquo;s go further.</p>
<p>Go through the before and after versions in detail&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What specifically do you notice?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are some of the more subtle techniques I used to improve it?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a perfect rewrite, but you can start to see what the process of thinking like a reporter looks like and how to turn a boring press release into &nbsp;something newsworthy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting these changes can help you internalize the mindset of writing press releases designed to get publicity, and make clients extremely happy.</p>

<h2><strong>Module 3 recap</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>When you&rsquo;re writing a press release, your most important audience is reporters.</li>
<li>Finding an angle that appeals to a wide audience and doing the &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; work upfront makes it more likely your press release will get publicized.</li>
<li>Use real names, statistics and facts, and quotes to make your press release more credible and exciting.</li>
<li>Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;News&rdquo; tab is a great source for relevant info to support your copy. (Always make sure to attribute properly when including info from outside sources.)</li>
<li>The easiest way to get quotes is to write them for your client (or their customers) &mdash; just make sure to get them approved by the people you&rsquo;re quoting!</li>
<li>Never turn your press release into an advertisement for your client &mdash; it will do more harm than good.</li>
<li>A great press release headline is: Strong, straight to the point, specific, and significant to the journalist whose desk it lands on.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t bury the lead. Put your most important and exciting information right up front &mdash; preferably in the first couple of sentences.</li>
<li>Your press release is finished when you&rsquo;ve answered all of the relevant questions: Who, what, when, where, why, and how.</li>
