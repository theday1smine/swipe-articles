<div>Landing pages come in lots of different sizes, styles, and designs. Clients can hire you to write anything from a simple opt-in page to a longer, more in-depth page.</div>

<div>They might call it a “squeeze page”, “lead capture page”, “lander”, or even a “destination page”.</div>

<div>Don’t get hung up on any of these details. Regardless of the size, shape, or what you call it, the job of a landing page is to promote a specific offer.</div>

<div>And the goal of your landing page copy is to get as many people as possible to take that offer.</div>

<div>In this lesson, I’ll show you exactly how to do that — in any situation.</div>

<div>No matter what type of page you’re writing, the lessons you learn in this module will cover everything you need to create a high-converting page your clients will love.</div>


<h4>The first step to writing a great landing page </h4>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div>Unlike other forms of copywriting (e.g. email), landing page copy doesn’t just sit there on the page. It fits into a design scheme, like furniture fits into a house.</div>

<div>Understanding this allows you to write better copy, faster, with less effort.</div>

<div>For example, a client once asked me to write copy for a landing page asking people to sign up for a free service. What do you think my first question was?</div>

<div>Think about it for a moment before moving on.</div>

<div>Most people I pose this challenge to — even professional freelance copywriters — answer with something like, “Who is your target audience?”</div>

<div>But the real answer is: <strong> Do you have a particular design or template in mind for this landing page? </strong></div>

<div>At which point he showed me a design layout that looked like this:</div>

<p><img class="image22" src="NBImages/20180618-183315.jpg" data-featherlight="NBImages/20180618-183315.jpg" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" alt="" /></p>
<div>

<div>If I hadn’t asked this question, I’d have written the landing page flying blind. It would’ve been like trying to decorate a house, without knowing the square footage, or how many rooms it contained.</div>

<div>Instead, I was able to use the template as a blueprint to help me write the perfect amount of copy, and know exactly what to focus on — like a “paint by numbers” guide.</div>

<div>Here’s the exact copy I sent to the client. Notice how it corresponds exactly with the template he had picked out:</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="image22" src="NBImages/20180618-183513.jpg" data-featherlight="NBImages/20180618-183513.jpg" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" alt="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<div>The more you know about the physical layout of the page, the easier it will be to write great copy for it. In this case, I used the template as my “road map” — of course, I still had to write great copy, but it gave me a blueprint for exactly what to write, where.</div>

<div>Now let’s go a step deeper and talk about the strategy I used to write the copy for this page.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="textbox7">
<h2>Strategy Breakdown #1</h2>
<p>You already know the importance of understanding the reader’s story before you write a word of copy. But it’s even more critical to writing landing page copy, because the strategic decisions you’ll make often have just as much to do with how the reader <em> arrives </em> on the page as they do with the offer itself!</p>
<p>Watch the video below to find out more:</p>
<div><video controls="controls" width="100%" height="auto">
				<source src="NBImages/FCCvideos/FCC-M6-1-How-to-think-about-landing-pages_DOWN.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
				<source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
			</video></div>
<p>Here was the reader’s story in this case:</p>
<ol>
<li>They decided they wanted to buy a house</li>
<li>Next, they visited a real estate agent — but didn’t know their credit score or price range</li>
<li>The real estate agent sent them a link to this landing page where they could get a “Home Financing Certificate” that would show their ideal price range for a new home based on their credit history</li>
</ol>
<p>Thinking about the landing page as an <em> extension </em> of where they came from, I knew the copy we opened with should feel like a continuation of their conversation with their real estate agent.</p>
<p>But I also didn’t want it to sound too formal or “businesslike”. Can you figure out why? Take a moment to think about it before you keep reading.</p>
<p>It’s because buying a house is fun and exciting! Trying to hook them with words like “credit” or “home financing certificate” doesn’t sound like much fun, does it?</p>
<p>In fact, one of the first lines of copy I came up with for the page said that buying a home “should be exciting, not confusing.” (This type of “why” oriented copy connects with people on a deep emotional level.)</p>
<p>Once I had their attention, it was time to explain how it works. I did this for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The template the client had picked out for this landing page contained a step-by-step “How it works” section</li>
<li>Unless you’re offering something self-explanatory (e.g. an ebook), it’s usually a good idea to explain how it works</li>
</ol>
<p>But notice that I didn’t just explain how it works in a cold, technical fashion.</p>
<p>I also explained what was in it for THEM (for example, a quicker approval process). People are always wondering, “What’s in it for ME?” — the better you answer that question throughout your landing page copy, the more successful it’ll be.</p>
<p>Next, I included a testimonial — again, this was part of the landing page template the client had chosen, but I always try to use testimonials on landing pages whenever possible. (You can get these right from the client, or you can charge them extra to interview their customers, as you learned in Module 1.)</p>
<p>The landing page template the client had chosen also contained some additional space at the bottom to mention (and briefly discuss) more features and benefits. I’d already loaded up the copy with plenty of these already, but this was a great place to mention an ancillary feature (free credit monitoring) that didn’t make sense to discuss earlier on the page.</p>
<p>I also used this space to reiterate that the offer was free, since it never hurts to mention key words like “free” multiple times.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the copy, I decided to “overcome objections.” After my initial conversation with the client (and doing my own mental Role Reversal exercise), I knew the reader would likely have questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How do I know this is legit?”</li>
<li>And: “Will it hurt my credit score?”</li>
</ul>
<p>So I made sure to devote a few lines of copy to addressing those concerns.</p>
<p>Had this landing page been aimed at “cold” traffic — rather than readers who’d be warmed up by their relationship with their real estate agent — I may have tried to overcome one or more of these objections even earlier, possibly even in the headline.</p>
<p>I also probably would have made the headline longer, explaining the offer in a bit more detail. But since visitors were sent here by a real estate professional, none of that was necessary.</p>
<p>One more thing you may have noticed is how authentic the copy feels. In fact, it almost seems as though I have an intimate knowledge of what it means to get a home financing certificate from this company — even though I’d never heard of anything like this before the client asked me to write the page.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to find out how I pull this off:</p>
<p> </p>
<div><video controls="controls" width="100%" height="auto">

				<source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
			</video></div>
</div>
<br />

<div>Will this same strategy work for every landing page you write? Of course not. You need to put your Detective Hat on and always be looking for the best approach for each situation.</div>

<div>Let’s look at an example of how I tackled a landing page in a completely different situation:</div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="image22" src="NBImages/20180618-194041.jpg" data-featherlight="NBImages/20180618-194041.jpg" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" alt="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At first glance, you’ll notice that this page contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>More copy</li>
<li>More Call To Action buttons &amp; testimonials</li>
<li>And a more formal tone</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some good reasons for that! Read the case study below for a deep dive into the exact strategies I used to write the copy for this page.</p>
<br /> <br />
<div class="textbox7">
<h2>Strategy breakdown #2</h2>
<p>While the target audience for the previous landing page was homebuyers, this page targeted lawyers. And not just any lawyers — these would be attorneys looking for expert witnesses they could put on the witness stand to testify in court.</p>
<p>And unlike the previous page, the traffic arriving at this page was completely <strong> cold </strong> . The reader probably searched Google for a phrase like “expert witness”, and had little-to-no knowledge about the offer they were about to see.</p>
<p>In other words, they’d be less familiar with what we were offering — while also being more skeptical.</p>
<p>This meant we’d need to do more explaining and more convincing — hence the longer page with more information to help them make a decision.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another key decision that differed from the previous example: The tone of the copy.</p>
<p>While buying a home is fun and exciting, hiring an expert witness to testify in court is serious business. In fact, while I sometimes discourage clients from being overly formal, in this case I specifically asked the client for a few technical terms we could throw around in order to build trust and credibility with this “hardcore” audience.</p>
<p>Let’s move on and talk about the copy itself.</p>
<p>At first glance, it might seem like the right way to tackle a page like this would be to focus on the benefits of finding a great expert witness (for example, winning more trials).</p>
<p>But when the client filled me in on the reader’s story, I started to realize it shouldn’t be the #1 focus of the page.</p>
<p>He explained that lawyers already understand the enormous value of using expert witnesses in court. Their big problem is FINDING one.</p>
<p>As the client explained to me, the right expert witness needs to have lots of specialized qualities — including the right credentials, previous experience testifying in court, and more. This makes it extremely difficult to find the right expert witness, especially on a tight timeline.</p>
<p>And the few services that have historically tried to solve this problem didn’t do it very well. So lawyers were used to being burned — paying too much for questionable “experts” from fast talking online marketers.</p>
<p>In order to convert as many readers as possible, I knew my top priority would be to show them that the service was reliable and trustworthy, and would deliver exactly what they need.</p>
<p>One framework I use in this type of situation is to ask the client, “If I were the reader, what are all of the things that might PREVENT me from signing up for this service?” Then I make sure we address each and every one of those things in the copy.</p>
<p>In other words, I treat the copy as a way to overcome every conceivable objection. Which is exactly what I did here. For example, the client explained to me that lawyers who use their competitors’ services end up getting billed twice — once from the service, and once from the witness. Once I knew that, overcoming this objection was as easy as saying “You’ll only receive 1 bill from us — period.”</p>
<p>Another subtle concern the client pointed out to me was the fact that lawyers are often in a rush, and need to find an expert witness quickly. They’re worried about wasting valuable time on a “wild goose chase.” So I made it a special point to mention that we’d respond to them quickly after they requested their quote.</p>
<p>There are tons of other great nuggets I got from the client — all of which I never would have been able to come up with on my own. These are the type of details that will help you take your copy from “OK” to “awesome.”</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div>Later in this week’s lesson, we’ll go into even more detail about the specific techniques I used to write the copy for this page.</div>

<div>For now, let’s analyze a totally different landing page I wrote — this one doubling as a Home Page for a therapist’s website:</div>
</div>

<div><img class="image22" src="NBImages/20180618-200011.jpg" data-featherlight="NBImages/20180618-200011.jpg" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" alt="" /></div>
<br />
<div class="textbox7">
<h2><strong> Strategy breakdown #3 </strong></h2>
<p>These days, many businesses and professionals use landing pages as their website’s “home page” as a way to increase leads and sales, while giving their website a cleaner look.</p>
<p>While all landing pages contain some of the same elements — like headline, bullets, call to action — you can see that this one is quite different from the previous two examples I’ve shown you.</p>
<p>For one thing, it’s much shorter than the “expert witness” page we just looked at. Why do you suppose that is? The answer might surprise you…</p>
<p>The reason I kept this page short is because no matter how hard I pressed, the client did not give me as much information as I would have liked. And that’s OK! It’s just one of the realities of being a freelance copywriter.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re a writer, not a magician. The client was still perfectly happy with the copy, and even turned into a repeat customer.</p>
<p>Another thing you may notice is that this page starts off with a few longer paragraphs of copy.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>As the client explained to me, readers arriving at this page are struggling with life and are often in a lot of pain.</p>
<p>They’re looking not just for a “solution,” but for a human being who understands them.</p>
<p>If readers arrive and see a lot of sections filled with bullet points and one-liners, they wouldn’t feel that human touch you’d expect to find on a page like this.</p>
<p>In other words, this page wasn’t as much about “selling” as it was a personal message from a therapist to the people who needed her help.</p>
<p>I needed to make them feel like a real person was speaking to them, so I created longer paragraphs that are personal, conversational and human.</p>
<p>Similarly, you may have noticed that in the earlier example, the first call-to-action button is in the header directly beneath the headline. That makes sense for a “strictly business” type of service where many people will be ready to take the next step very quickly. But in this case, it would have been tacky and insensitive to move people to the appointment too quickly.</p>
<p>This is yet another reason why I’m not fond of “formulas” when it comes to writing great landing page copy. Yes, there are certain elements that every landing page will contain — and we’ll discuss these in more detail shortly.</p>
<p>But never lose sight of the fact that each project has its own unique variables and goals. That’s how you move from being “just a writer” to a top professional clients love doing business with, over and over again.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div>As you can see, when it comes to landing page copy, there is no perfect “one size fits all” strategy. The key is to look at the specific offer, as well as the reader’s story, and think STRATEGICALLY.</div>

<div>It’s also a good idea to (briefly) explain your strategy to the client. Clients love this because it gives them context for the copywriting decisions and techniques you’re using.</div>

<div>There’s no need to go overboard — a few bullet points of explanation can be a great way to warm them up and ensure they love the copy you’ve written for them.</div>
</div>

<h2><strong> The “heart and soul” of your landing page </strong></h2>
<div>
<div>If strategy is the engine that drives your landing page copy, amazing bullet points are the lifeblood that flows through it.</div>

<div>There are three different levels of bullet points you can choose from:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>One-line “zinger” bullets</li>
<li>Expanded bullets</li>
<li>“Supercharged” mini-section bullets</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Depending on the landing page you’re writing, you may choose to use one, two, or even a combination of all three.</div>

<div>Let’s go over each one in more detail:</div>
</div>


<div>
<h3><strong> 1) One-line “zinger” bullets </strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>These work best when you want to describe something that’s straightforward and direct. There are a few different ways you can use one-line “zinger” bullets, depending on the situation.</div>

<div>For example, you can use bullets to create curiosity. This works great for information-related offers, like webinars or ebooks. Here’s an example of the curiosity-building bullets on our FTW landing page offering my 5 Upwork hacks:</div>

</div>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200542.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20180618-200542.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>To write these bullets, I went through each email hack and asked myself two questions:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>“If I were reading these for the first time, which parts would I find most surprising?”</li>
<li>“How can I make these sound as cool as possible?” (e.g. “Scientifically proven”, “Raise my rates by $50/hr overnight”, “Takes just 3 minutes to execute”)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>Then I described what the hack can help you accomplish, without mentioning the actual hack. BOOM! A short, irresistible set of bullets that makes it practically impossible to not sign up.</div>

<div><strong> You can also use one-line “zinger” bullets to highlight straightforward features, like this: </strong></div>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200712.png" data-featherlight="NBImages/20180618-200712.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image"alt="" /></div>
<p> </p>
<div><strong> Or even to simply highlight the BENEFITS of an offer. </strong></div>

<div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200742.png" alt="" /></div>

</div>
<div>
<div>When I write “benefit-driven” bullets, the question I ask myself is not “What will they get out of this product?”, but rather “What will they NOT get if they DON’T have this product?” This taps into their FOMO (“fear of missing out”), which is one of the most powerful psychological forces you can use.</div>

<div><strong> Another great use for one-line “zinger” bullets is to call out specific readers by explaining exactly who an offer is for: </strong></div>
</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200833.png" alt="" /></div>

<div><strong> You can also call out specific readers by their DESIRES. This works great when you don’t have specific information, such as their profession, geographic location, gender, age, etc. </strong></div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200908.png" alt="" /></div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-200931.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>In the example above, I didn’t need to come up with any of these bullets on my own. They came directly from the client, who gave me a list of lessons that were covered in his information product. All I needed to do was choose the lessons that were most exciting, and tweak them into bullets that “zing”.</div>

<h3><strong> 2) Expanded bullets </strong></h3>
<div>These contain more copy than “zingers” and are usually preceded by a short title. They’re my “go-to” bullets when I need to convey detailed information, and a one-liner just won’t cut it.</div>

<div>For example, if you want to persuade readers to buy an ebook, it’s more powerful to spell out the contents of each chapter, rather than just mentioning the benefits.</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>You can also use expanded bullets to persuade readers to do something that asks them to make a commitment, such as:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Signing up for a free trial</li>
<li>Ordering a monthly subscription</li>
<li>Scheduling an appointment</li>
<li>Or requesting a demo</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Or you can use them to break down and simplify ideas that are technical or confusing, like business services and software products.</div>

<div>
<div><strong> Examples: </strong></div>

</div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201335.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Expanded bullets are a great way to describe health products and supplements, when you want to highlight the benefits of each individual ingredient:</div>

</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201604.png" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<div>
<h3><strong> 3) Supercharged “mini-section” bullets </strong></h3>

<div>Mini-section bullets are more of a paragraph than a bullet, and they are usually “roped off” into their own section on the page. Most mini-section bullets begin with a subheadline.</div>
</div>


<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201730.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<div>
<div>Supercharged mini-section bullets are a great way to pack in a lot of information, while keeping the page neat and “clean”.</div>

<div>For example, if your landing page is promoting a financial advisory firm that offers a variety of services, you can use mini-section bullets to show readers a “snapshot” of each service.</div>

<div><strong> Example: </strong></div>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201827.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<h2><strong> Getting readers to “pull the trigger” </strong></h2>
<div>It may be tempting to think that once your copy has done its job persuading the reader, the rest is just logistics.</div>

<div>But the reality is, landing page readers are not committed until they’ve “pulled the trigger”. Any snag in the process can give readers second thoughts, which can lead to fewer conversions.</div>

<div>For this reason, your call-to-action needs to be strategically crafted to get readers to cross the finish line.</div>

<div>I always make sure to tell clients that calls-to-action that have fewer fields to fill out are scientifically proven to get more signups.</div>

<div>Asking for less information doesn’t just make the process simpler. When readers see you asking for too much personal information (eg. address, phone number), their “antennas” kick into high gear, and they get ambivalent about the offer.</div>

<div>On our FTW opt-in pages, we only ask for 2 pieces of information:</div>
</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201918.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Some landing pages have just one field for the email address:</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-201946.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Now let’s discuss how to write the call-to-action copy itself.</div>

<div>Most call-to-action sections have 2 copy areas:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>The call-to-action headline</li>
<li>The call-to-action button</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>The headline is not supposed to introduce any new information. It’s job is to give readers a final emotional “push” across the finish line. It should be short and exciting, and specify the action you want readers to take. You can use this area to summarize the offer, highlight a key benefit, or remind the reader the offer is free.</div>

<div>
<div><strong> Examples: </strong></div>

</div>
<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-202120.png" alt="" /></div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-202524.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Your call-to-action button should be as specific as possible. Rather than saying “Buy now” or “Order today”, try to mention the specific product, or highlight a benefit the reader can expect.</div>

<div>There are many ways to do this, and the more creative you get, the happier your client will be.</div>

<div>Here are some examples of creative call-to-action buttons:</div>

<div><img src="NBImages/20180618-202720.png" alt="" /></div>

<div>
<div>Here are some more tips for writing call-to-action buttons that stand out and get clicks:</div>

<div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Show readers it’s fast and easy: “Get a quote in less than 5 minutes”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Write it from the reader’s perspective: “Raise my IQ”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add urgency: “Join now — space is limited”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong> Writing an enticing headline — in under 10 minutes </strong></h2>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div>
<div>A lot of copywriters spend a long time coming up with their landing page headline. It never takes me more than a few minutes to come up with several powerful headlines.</div>

<div>Here are the 3 steps I use to come up with multiple headlines for any landing page:</div>
</div>


<div>
<h3><strong> 1) Copy and paste </strong></h3>
<div>My “first line of defense” with headline writing is to see if it’s already written. After you’ve written the copy, you can often one or even multiple lines that can be used as your headline — either “as is”, or with a bit of tweaking. It may be a bullet, subhead, or any other part of the page.</div>

<div>Before I write a headline from scratch, I go down the page looking for any line that has the potential to be a headline. Then I see how it looks, and if needed, I tweak it. Presto — I’ve got an instant headline.</div>

<div>Here’s an example of a line I originally placed near the bottom of a piece of landing page copy — promoting the service of a high-end logo designer — which ended up being my headline:</div>

<div><strong> “This Is One Of The Most Powerful — Yet Underrated — Marketing Tools In Your Arsenal” </strong></div>
</div>
<div><strong>   </strong></div>
<div class="textbox7 textyblack">
<h2><strong> The headline I wrote in 10 seconds </strong></h2>
<p>I was once hired to write a landing page for a company that produced state-of-the-art hearing aids.</p>
<p>My client explained that the number one benefit his hearing aid offered was that the sound was super clear and lifelike, while his competitors’ hearing aids sounded metallic and distorted. His product imitated the human ear so closely, it amplified the sounds people wanted to hear, and filtered out background noise, solving one of the biggest problems faced by people who are hearing-impaired.</p>
<p>Because many companies make similar promises (eg. “sounds lifelike”), but don’t deliver, I needed a headline that conveyed that this life-changing product was the next best thing to having a fully-operational human ear.</p>
<p>I came up with several options that were “OK”, before I noticed a line buried in my own landing page copy —</p>
<p>” <strong> <em> Our hearing aids ask themselves ‘What would an ear do?’…and they do the EXACT same thing!” </em> </strong></p>
<p>I instantly realized that my headline had been staring me in the face! The client loved it, and told me that he was so excited, he wouldn’t be able to sleep that night.</p>

<h3><strong> 2) Use my headline generator </strong></h3>
<div>If you can’t find any line in your copy that works, your next line of defense is to use my headline generator tool (in the bonus section) to quickly create a headline based on proven templates.</div>

<h3><strong> 3) Write 25 headlines </strong></h3>
<div>If all else fails, write 25 headlines as quickly as possible. (This is similar to the subject line technique we discussed in Module 2.) With practice, you should be able to do this in 5-10 minutes max. Go through each one and eliminate the ones you don’t like. You should be left with at least 3 or 4 solid headlines.</div>
</div>

<h2><strong> Three important rules to keep in mind when writing headline copy: </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>   </strong></h3>
<h3><strong> 1) Avoid headline confusion. </strong></h3>
<div>Remember, the headline is NOT the first thing the reader is seeing. The landing page is not the first stop on their journey, and they’ve come here by clicking on a link. To have a successful headline, it needs to keep the flow moving, and be a smooth progression.</div>

<div>When writing your headline, make sure to keep in mind the advertisement, email, blog post, or link the reader is coming from, and figure out what they’re expecting to see next.</div>
</div>

<div>
<h3><strong> 2) Eliminate extra words. </strong></h3>
<div>You can almost always delete these extraneous words from your headline: Just, so, very, really, it, and, but, of, some, and like.</div>

<h3><strong> 3) Send a few options. </strong></h3>
<div>It’s always a good idea to send 2 or 3 additional headline options to your client. Make it clear which one you like the best, and label the others “alternate options.”</div>

<div>Headlines are more art than science, and it’s always helpful to give your client a few to choose from. Extra headlines also come in handy in case your client wants to do an A/B test.</div>
