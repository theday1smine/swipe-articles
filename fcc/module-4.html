                <p>An explainer video is a short animated video designed to get viewers to take some sort of ACTION. It could be buying a product, booking an appointment, downloading a white paper, calling for a free consult, or anything else.</p>
                <p>Explainer videos can go by many different names, including&nbsp;<em>whiteboard video, animated video, homepage video, marketing video,&nbsp;and more.</em></p>

                <p>Don’t get too hung up on the terminology or format… If someone wants a short animated video, you’ll be able to use what you learn in this module to help them.</p>
                <p>Writing explainer videos comes with a lot of benefits :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As online video production gets easier and cheaper, the demand for great scripts just keeps growing</li>
                    <li>They’re fun! You get to be creative and tell entertaining stories (even if you’re not a “natural storyteller”)</li>
                    <li>You can charge good money for them (it’s not uncommon to get paid $150+ or more, even for a short script of just 150 words)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this module, you’ll learn exactly how to write an effective explainer video script for any situation.</p>
                <h3><strong>Your real job as an explainer video copywriter&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                <p>Years ago, explainer videos were used almost exclusively by businesses as a quick, easy way to break down complicated, confusing, or technical products or ideas.</p>
                <p>But as explainer videos have skyrocketed in popularity, it’s become fashionable for any business to have an explainer video — even if they don’t have anything new, complicated, or unfamiliar to actually&nbsp;explain.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Today organizations big and small use them to market anything from food products, to muffler repair, dentistry, training courses, live events, charities, and much much more. Like this one — from a financial planner:</p>
            </div>
                        <video controls="controls" height="auto" width="100%"><source src="NBimages/FCCvideos/FCC-M4-2-Eastgate-Financial-Group.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg"></video>
            <p>Regardless what type of business (or nonprofit) you’re writing for, a great explainer video is&nbsp;more like a mini-movie than an instruction manual.<strong>&nbsp;Your primary job is to connect with viewers on an&nbsp;</strong><strong>emotional level.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, your video scripts can and will explain your client’s product or service. But it’s the emotional triggers that grab viewers’ interest, keep them engaged, and even get them to act.</p>
            <p>This idea of tapping into emotions — rather than relying on logic — is something you’ll find useful throughout all forms of copywriting.&nbsp;And it has special importance to explainer videos.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To understand why, think about how you feel when you start playing an online video:&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Yes, you probably want to learn something, but you also expect to be entertained!</p>
            <p>You don’t need to be the second coming of Chris Rock in order to pull this off when you’re writing an explainer video script. I’ll show you how anyone can do it.</p>
            <p>Let’s discuss the first step…</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>How to structure your script</strong></h3>
            <p>Structuring your script properly&nbsp;is the best way to set yourself up for success, before you even write a single word.</p>
            <p>It’s like having a recipe when you sit down to cook — it makes things easier and ensures you’ll end up with a delicious meal.</p>
            <p>There are 6 main “ingredients” you’ll usually be working with when you write an explainer video script:</p>
            <h4><strong>Introduce the problem</strong></h4>
            <p>The first part of every explainer video. You simply create a character and give him/her a problem they need to solve.</p>
            <h4><strong>Expand the problem</strong></h4>
            <p>This is where you “raise the stakes” for your character. You can make the problem more “real” by going into more&nbsp;detail; pile on additional “second order” problems; or even talk about all the bad stuff that will happen if the character fails to solve the problem.</p>
            <h4><strong>Introduce the solution</strong></h4>
            <p>Now it’s time to give some hope to your character — as well as some love to your client — by introducing their product/service into the mix. This is the solution that will ultimately help your character solve their problem and give him or her a happy ending.</p>
            <h4><strong>Explain the solution in more detail</strong></h4>
            <p>This is why they call it an explainer video; here you’ll elaborate on the solution so viewers understand exactly how it works, how it can help them solve THEIR problem in real life.</p>
            <h4><strong>Overcome an objection</strong></h4>
            <p>This will typically be the #1 objection or frequently asked question people have about the product/service you’re showcasing in the video. (This is the least common of all the ingredients, but it can come in handy when you need it.)</p>
            <h4><strong>Call to action</strong></h4>
            <p>This is where you tell viewers what to do next. It can be checking out a link, downloading a white paper, calling for more information, or anything else your client wants viewers to do after watching the video.</p>
            <p>You won’t always use all of these ingredients. Which ones you decide to use, and how much space you devote to each one, will depend upon a number of variables, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The purpose of the video (a simple product like a potato peeler won’t require as much&nbsp;explanation&nbsp;as a new tech device)</li>
                <li>The length of the video</li>
                <li>How much information the client gives you (ideally clients will give you plenty of information for all 6 areas — but in reality, sometimes you just need to work with what you’ve got)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here’s an example of a 2-minute (~300 word) script where I used&nbsp;all&nbsp;of the 6 ingredients above:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-200214.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-200214.png" ></p>
            <p>Keep in mind the number of words you devote to each ingredient can vary from script to script depending on the length of the video, the client’s preferences, the topic you’re writing about, and more.</p>
            <p>For example, did you notice how the call to action in the script above is a bit “light?”</p>
            <p>The client wanted a 2-minute (~300-word) script, so I had to make some judgment calls. In this case, we’re asking them to sign up to a&nbsp;<strong>free</strong>&nbsp;service — so I decided to spend more time telling a good story about the value of the service, while using a few less words on the call to action itself. (I explained this to the client when I delivered my first draft, and he loved it.</p>
            <p>Next, let’s look at an example of a&nbsp;<strong>shorter</strong>&nbsp;script where I used fewer ingredients:<br>
            <img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-201228.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-201228.png" ></p>
            <p>If you look closely, you’ll see<strong>&nbsp;I didn’t explicitly mention or overcome any specific objections</strong>.&nbsp;And I was more brief in my explanations of the&nbsp;<strong>problem&nbsp;and&nbsp;solution.</strong></p>
            <p>Why? For one thing, this video was only&nbsp;half&nbsp;the length of the previous one, so there wasn’t room to go into as many details.Nor were as many details needed for this script! The technical details of&nbsp;how&nbsp;the product works aren’t as important because people already understand what a “workbook” is. It was more important to focus on the emotional aspects of explaining who the product is for, and how it can HELP THEM.</p>
            <p>Would it have been wrong&nbsp;to devote a bit more room to explaining the product, while “skimping” a little on one or more of the other sections? Not at all. This is more art than science! The most important thing to do is use your judgment — if you’re working&nbsp;strategically, and the client is happy, you’re doing something right.</p>
            <p>In a moment, we’ll dive into exactly how to write an explainer video script for any situation.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>First, let’s go over my 3 rules for writing awesome explainer video copy.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>3 Rules for writing awesome explainer video copy</strong></h3>
            <h4><strong>Rule #1:&nbsp;People first, products second</strong></h4>
            <p>People can’t relate to products or services — at least not directly.</p>
            <p>But they relate incredibly well to&nbsp;<strong>other people.</strong></p>
            <p>That’s why Kim Kardashian can instantly turn an ordinary product&nbsp;into a hot new trend with a single tweet:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-201938.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-201938.png" ></p>
            <p>Of course, your scripts aren’t likely to feature many celebrities.&nbsp;But they will feature another one of your viewer’s favorite VIPs:&nbsp;<strong>THEMSELVES!</strong></p>
            <p>No, they won’t literally see themselves featured in your video… Instead, you’ll create a character — like Joe, or Jane — and give them all of the same problems, challenges, fears, reservations, hopes, and dreams as the person watching the video.</p>
            <p>Watch this video below to see how I create&nbsp;great characters quickly and easily:&nbsp;</p>
            <video controls="controls" height="auto" width="100%"><source src="NBImages/FCCvideos/FCC-M4-3-Creating-characters.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg"></video>
            <div>
                This is also why I spend at least as much time asking the client about their CUSTOMER, as I do on their product or service.
            </div>
            <div>
                As you know by now, asking the right questions is one of the keys to writing great copy that gets results. This is incredibly important in explainer video copywriting because you need to be able to tell the viewer’s story in an authentic way.
            </div>
            <div>
                Let’s look at a real life example of how I do this:
            </div>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-202601.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-202601.png" ></p>
            <p>Imagine someone planning for retirement watching this story unfold. They can’t help but relate to it…because it’s their story! The more the viewer sees&nbsp;themselves in the video, the more successful your script will be.</p>
            <h4><strong>Rule #2: Show, don’t tell</strong></h4>
            <div>
                In the climactic scene of the movie Glory, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw needs to inspire his soldiers to charge the confederate army — in spite of the fact that many of them will be walking into certain death.
            </div>
            
            <div>
                Does he give a rousing speech? HELL NO.&nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                Instead, he points his sword forward…and begins the charge himself.
            </div>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-202714.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-202714.png" ></p>
            <div>
                Colonel Shaw knew that the IMAGE of him charging forward would be infinitely more powerful than any combination of words he could muster together.
            </div>
            <div>
                The world’s most elite copywriters have all internalized this same truth.
            </div>
            <div>
                They don’t use words to DESCRIBE.&nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                They use them to SHOW you things.&nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                That’s how they connect to your deepest emotions and spur you to action.
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>To see what I mean, compare the following two sentences:</strong>
            </div>
            <div>“The thought of an IRS audit made Laura feel stressed and anxious.”
            </div>
            <div>
                “Laura imagined an IRS auditor knocking on her door. She massaged her temples as her head began to throb.”
            </div>
            <div>
                Notice how the first one uses words to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;you what Laura is feeling… While the second one SHOWS you what she’s feeling, giving you a far more vivid and emotional EXPERIENCE.
            </div>
            <div>
                Which one do you think would convert better? Personally, I’d bet $10,000 on “Door #2” without a second thought.
            </div>
            <div>
                My favorite way to ensure you’re always SHOWING, instead of telling, is to use VISUAL WORDS.&nbsp;Watch the video below to find out more:
            </div>
           <video controls="controls" height="auto" width="100%"><source src="NBImages/FCCvideos/FCC-M4-4-Creating-characters.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg"></video>
            <p>Here are a few more examples of showing vs. telling sentences:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-204822.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-204822.png" ></p>
            <p>When you’re writing the first draft of your script, it’s OK to start out with some “telling” sentences. But by the time you go back to edit (preferably the next day, or at least a few hours later) you should make a conscious effort to go from&nbsp;<strong>telling</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>showing</strong>.</p>
            <h4><strong>Rule #3: Drama, drama, drama</strong></h4>
            <p>People love drama. Learning how to create drama is one of the hallmarks of a great script writer.</p>
            <p>Imagine hearing someone say that “Jim hasn’t been sleeping well.” It definitely sounds like a nuisance, but there’s nothing particularly DRAMATIC about it.</p>
            <p>Watch the video below to learn 2 quick and easy ways to beef up the drama in an explainer video.</p><video controls="controls" height="auto" width="100%"><source src="NBImages/FCCvideos/FCC-M4-5-Visual-words.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg"></video>
            <p>Here are more examples of how I use the “degree” and “contrast” dials to&nbsp;turn low drama sentences into high drama sentences:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-204610.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-204610.png" ></p>
            <p>Remember, you don’t need to pack every sentence with the maximum amount of drama. And you don’t want to overdo it, either. But as a&nbsp;general rule most of the explainer video scripts I’ve read can easily&nbsp;use an extra dose — or two — of drama.</p>
            <h3><strong>Start with the problem</strong></h3>
            <p>A good explainer video script starts out by telling the viewer’s STORY — as authentically as possible.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You don’t want or need to go into every detail of their life. The key is to understand their problem — whatever it is they need to accomplish — in a way that feels “real” to them.</p>
            <p>At a minimum, after watching the opening of your video, the viewer needs to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Know this is meant for&nbsp;them <strong>specifically</strong></li>
                <li>Identify with the character in the video (“Hey, that’s exactly what I’m dealing with right now!”)</li>
                <li>Recognize that you have a solid understanding of exactly what they’re going through (this helps you position your client as an authority who can help the viewer solve the problem)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Let’s take a closer look at the “problem” portion of one of the scripts I showed you earlier:</strong></p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-205236.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-205236.png" ></p>
            <p>Imagine if all I’d known about the viewer was that they were a restaurant owner whose commercial fridge had gone out. What would my options have been? I could have either given that bare description of the problem, or make up something to use as “filler.”</p>
            <p><strong>Either way, the story would feel totally&nbsp;<em>flat</em>&nbsp;to the real restaurant owners watching it.</strong></p>
            <p>Instead, look at the extra details that make this story feel authentic to them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>“38 degrees”</em></li>
                <li><em>“Hungry lunch mob”</em></li>
                <li><em>“Food spoilage”</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is the kind of stuff you can’t just make up — and viewers know it. This gives it an authentic feel that signals to them that your client is an expert who can help them solve their problem.&nbsp;(In the bonus section of this module, I’ll give you an enormous treasure trove of juicy questions to help you uncover all of these details, and more.)</p>
            <p>Let’s look at another example. This one is a bit longer — it’s from a 3-minute (~450-word) script targeting private-practice physicians:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-205459.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-205459.png" ></p>
            <p>Notice&nbsp;how I don’t just INTRODUCE the problem — look at all the ways I EXPAND on it too:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Going into more detail (“Relying on referrals doesn’t cut it anymore”)</li>
                <li>Piling on additional problems</li>
                <li>Mentioning one of the pitfalls of not solving the problem</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If this looks intimidating, it&nbsp;<strong>shouldn’t&nbsp;be</strong> — the client gave me all of this info! I just put it into a neat little story and gave it right back to them.</p>
            <p>Nor do you necessarily need all of these details in order to write about the problem in an authentic way. Check out this very short opening from a 1-minute (~150-word) script I wrote for a day spa business:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-210029.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-210029.png" ></p>
            <p>In this case, it’s the little details like “she feels guilty any time she spends money on herself” that brings this story to life.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Let’s look at a few more examples…</p>

            <p><strong>One final note before we move on to the next section:&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>For the first draft of your script, don’t worry about how much space to devote to the “problem.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For now, just write down everything you know about it (which usually means everything the client has told you about it). Later, I’ll show you how figure out if you need to shorten it — as well as how to do it&nbsp;quickly and painlessly.</p>
            <h3><strong>Next, Introduce&nbsp;the solution</strong></h3>
            <p>Once you’ve done everything you can to showcase the problem the viewer wants to solve, it’s time to introduce — and explain — the solution.</p>
            <p>This part of your script is going to be mainly about the client and the product or service&nbsp;they’re offering.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You’ll explain exactly how it works, in a logical, step-by-step fashion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But make sure you don’t lose sight of the most important person: The viewer!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You need to make sure you tie the solution back to THEIR needs. How it helps them solve THEIR problem. Let’s take a closer look at the “solution” portion of the first script I showed you at the beginning of this lesson:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-210746.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-210746.png" ></p>
            <p>Notice how, even though I explained the ins-and-outs of how the service works, I never took the focus off of the viewer — and how it made HIS&nbsp;life better.</p>
            <p>Sometimes a product or service offers LOTS of benefits to the viewer. In that case, the client will probably want a script that’s a bit longer, so you can pack it with benefits.</p>
            <p>Check out this “solution” portion of a 3-minute (~450-word) script — notice how many benefits I was able to pack it with:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-210943.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-210943.png" ></p>
            <p>Sometimes, a solution doesn’t need much&nbsp;<em>technical</em>&nbsp;explanation. For example, if your video is meant to promote, say, a free report, everyone already knows how a free report works! In that case, instead of “explaining” the free report, you can make a bulleted list of all the things the viewer will learn from it.</p>
            <p>Take a look at an example of how I did this in a script meant to promote a book:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-211143.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-211143.png" ></p>
            <p>You can use this same “What will the viewer get out of it?” strategy for any type of product or service where a technical explanation isn’t required.</p>
            <p>Here’s another example — this one is from a video I wrote for a home maintenance company:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-211413.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-211413.png" ></p>
            <p>In this case, the company didn’t do anything special in the&nbsp;<em>technical</em>&nbsp;sense — so we listed out their services and tied the overall offer to a nice benefit for the viewer.</p>
            <h3>Closing your script with a strong call to action</h3>
            <p>An explainer video can be fun and entertaining, but make no mistake about it — it’s a powerful marketing tool intended to get viewers to take ACTION.</p>
            <p>The key is to give them something specific to DO. This can be a special offer, or, at the very least, a simple, straightforward NEXT STEP.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Make it clear not only what you want them to do, but WHY they should do it. Take a look at how I did this in the example below (notice how, in addition to giving them a clear call to action, I strengthened it by giving them lots of reasons to take the next step):</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-213907.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-213907.png" ></p>
            <p>It can be tempting to wrap things up with a “Plain Jane” call to action. But, whenever possible, it’s worth it to take a couple of extra minutes to dress it up a bit.&nbsp;You can even help your client craft a more&nbsp;urgent&nbsp;call to action, like I did in the following example:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-214526.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-214526.png" ></p>
            <p>Another technique you can use is to call out a specific group of people who should take the next step. This works great for situations where you’re not able to write a longer/stronger call to action:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-214644.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-214644.png" ></p>
            <p>You can also use this approach more generally, like this:</p>
            <p><img alt="" data-featherlight="NBImages/20171203-214841.png" data-featherlight-variant="long-image" src="NBImages/20171203-214841.png" ></p>
            <p>…or this:</p>

            <h3 class="section-title" data-lecture-id="5240203" data-lecture-url="/courses/337443/lectures/5240203" data-next-lecture-id="5240205" data-next-lecture-url="/courses/337443/lectures/5240205" data-previous-lecture-id="5240193" data-previous-lecture-url="/courses/337443/lectures/5240193" id="lecture_heading"><strong>Adjusting the length of your script</strong></h3>
            <p>Unlike emails, press releases, and other types of copywriting, explainer video clients usually need their script to contain a specific number of words. That’s because they’ve generally already decided on how long their video should be — your job is to write the number of words that fits that predetermined length.</p>
            <p>As a rule of thumb, 150 words equals about&nbsp;<strong>one minute of finished video.</strong> So if a client needs a 2-minute video, you’ll write 300 words…and so on. (There’s a little bit of wiggle room — you can usually squeeze in up to 175 words per minute if you need to, though&nbsp;it’s not ideal.)</p>
            <p>Once you’ve written the first draft of your script, your next step is to check the word count to see how closely it matches up with what the client needs.</p>
            <p>Most likely, you’ll either have too many words — or too few. This is perfectly&nbsp;normal, and I’ll show you my favorite quick fixes for dealing with either scenario.</p>
            <h4><strong>If&nbsp;you have too many words…</strong></h4>
            <p>If your client gives you a lot of info to work with, or you’re writing about a complicated topic, your first draft&nbsp;may end up longer than expected.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There are several ways to cut down your script when that happens. You may not need to do all of these — start with the least drastic ones first, and move down the list if you need to.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Look for “dead weight” words you can safely delete.&nbsp;</strong><em>Just, so, very, really, it,</em><em>and, but, of, some,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>like</em>&nbsp;can be removed surprisingly often.</li>
                <li><strong>Look for sentences that are repetitive, redundant, or don’t add anything to your script.</strong>&nbsp;Are there 2 sentences that each say more or less the same thing? Cut one. Did you mention a fringe benefit that isn’t too important? Remove it — as well as any other “expendable” sentences you need to in order to hit your target word count.</li>
                <li><strong>Wait 24 hours</strong><strong>.</strong> Whenever possible, take a day off and come back with fresh eyes. You’ll be amazed at how much easier it is to spot editing opportunities after not looking at your script for one full day.</li>
                <li><strong>If you must, you can always resort to “telling” instead of “showing.”</strong>&nbsp;It usually takes up fewer words. For example, you can replace “Ashley felt like she hadn’t slept in days…between getting the kids off to school by 8am, working 9-5, and keeping her house in order…” — with “Courtney is a stressed out mom.” It’s not ideal, but you’re a copywriter, not a miracle worker.</li>
                <li><strong>Trim down the call-to-action.&nbsp;</strong>Again, this isn’t the ideal solution. But when you’re working with a strict word count, sometimes you need to do whatever it takes to get there — and that’s OK.</li>
                <li><strong>See if the client is open to a longer script.&nbsp;</strong>When you believe the only way to cut your word count is to remove&nbsp;essential&nbsp;content, I suggest a quick email or phone call to the client. Let them know that you’re happy to cut it down if that’s what they want, but you think the longer version would be better. (You can always send&nbsp;them both options and let them decide.)</li>
            </ol>
            <h4><strong>“But Danny, what if my script has too&nbsp;few&nbsp;words?”</strong></h4>
            <p>If your first draft falls short of the target word count, no worries. There are plenty of ways to get it up to the right count, without sacrificing an ounce of quality.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In fact, if you play your cards right you can even make your script&nbsp;<strong>better and longer at the same time.</strong></p>
            <p>The key is to start with lots of good information. You’ll find tons of juicy questions to ask explainer video clients in the bonus section — here’s how you can use it to beef up your script’s word count:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Overcome an objection (or even 2).</strong>&nbsp;This is one of the quickest, easiest, and most valuable ways to add some length to your script. Even if your first draft&nbsp;already overcomes an objection, consider adding a second one. Go back to the info you got from your&nbsp;client and see what you can do.</li>
                <li><strong>Teach something of value.&nbsp;</strong>People love to learn things that lead them closer to solving a burning problem or achieving an intense desire. One of my favorite explainer videos was from a divorce attorney — he advised viewers going through a divorce to keep away from&nbsp;social media since their posts could be used against them in court. This approach is especially useful when your client is struggling to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Just ask, “What are some surprising tips we can give?” Then use 1-3 of them to beef up&nbsp;your script. &nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Do a “final recap” or summary.</strong>&nbsp;Need to add a few more words to your script, but feel like you’ve run out of things to say? No problem, just recap what you’ve already said! Going over your main points again at the end of your script doesn’t just work as “filler” — it’s also a great way to refresh the viewer’s memory. (You can also recap the BENEFITS the viewer will get from using the solution.)</li>
                <li><strong>Spruce&nbsp;up your Call To Action.&nbsp;</strong>Adding a few sentences to your CTA is one of the easiest ways to increase the value AND word count of your script. You can tie it to a benefit; expand a on how easy it is to take the next step; or even repeat the CTA again in different words. You can also add the company’s tagline if they have one.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a testimonial.&nbsp;</strong>You can copy and paste it directly into your script, or edit it a bit if you need to (if you do edit it, make sure to get the client’s approval).</li>
            </ol>

    <h3><strong>Module 4&nbsp;recap</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A great explainer video doesn’t just explain — it should also entertain and get viewers to take action.</li>
        <li>There are 6 main “ingredients”: Introduce the problem, Expand the problem, Introduce the solution, Explain the solution, Overcome an objection, and Call To Action.</li>
        <li>The best explainer videos feature characters with the same problems, challenges, fears, hopes, and dreams as the viewer.</li>
        <li>Use “visual words” that SHOW the story unfolding, instead of just describing it.</li>
        <li>The opening of your script should show viewers you understand THEIR SPECIFIC problem — in as much detail as possible.</li>
        <li>You can amp up the drama of your script by raising the DEGREE of the problem, and adding CONTRAST to make it seem more stark.</li>
        <li>Your explanation of how the solution works should be a logical, step-by-step “demonstration.</li>
        <li>Make sure to tie the solution back to the viewer’s needs, and how it can make their life better.</li>
        <li>Sometimes a deep technical explanation of how the solution works isn’t required. In that case, just show the viewer what they’ll get from using it.</li>
        <li>When writing the Call To Action, don’t just tell the viewer what to do — tell them WHY they should do it.</li>
        <li>You can beef up your Call To Action using “urgency,” or by calling out a specific group of people who should take the next step.</li>
        <li>As a rule of thumb, 150 words is equal to about 1-minute of video.</li>
        <li>If your first draft is too long, you can: Cut “dead weight” words, remove repetitive or redundant sentences, wait 24 hours and edit with fresh eyes. If needed, you can also resort to “telling” instead of “showing,” trim down the Call To Action, or even ask if the client is open to a longer script.</li>
        <li>If your first draft is too short, you can: Teach something of value, overcome an an objection (or 2), add in a “recap”, spruce up your Call To Action, or include one or more testimonials.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>What is the purpose of this explainer video? What is the “solution” you are you promoting in it? (This can be a product or service, but it can also be a free solution, like a white paper, free consult, etc.)</li>
                <li>What is the main problem or burning desire your viewer has (that your solution is intended to help them solve)? • Why are they seeking a solution to this NOW (as opposed to yesterday, last week, or last year)?</li>
                <li>How do they think about that problem or burning desire? What does it feel like? What sort of words do they use to describe it or complain about it to a friend? If they woke up at 4am thinking about it, what would their internal dialogue sound like? • What will happen to them if they don’t solve the problem (or achieve the burning desire) soon? Will things get worse? Will a window of opportunity close? Please explain.</li>
                <li>How will your solution help them fix their problem or achieve their burning desire? What are the exact, specific steps involved? Please answer in as much detail as possible.</li>
                <li>What are ALL the ways their life be improved after using your solution? If they were talking to a friend or relative describing their successful experience, what would that conversation sound like?</li>
                <li>Are there other methods they could use to solve their problem or achieving their burning desire? Have they likely tried any of these?</li>
                <li>If they haven’t tried anything else, is there a reason why not? (Examples: “No solution existed before this one”; “They couldn’t afford the other solutions out there”; “They’ve been in denial, telling themselves the problem will just go away on its own”)</li>
                <li>Is there anything that makes YOUR solution different or superior to the alternatives? Is it cheaper, better, more durable, more reliable, or…? Does it come with better customer service, does it help businesses become more profitable, is it better for the environment? Is it just for men, just for women, or does it have more bells and whistles? Please describe ANY important differences in as much DETAIL as possible.</li>
                <li>Why are other solutions to this problem not as effective as yours? What shortcomings, problems, or frustrations will they encounter if they don’t choose your product?</li>
                <li>How do your customers usually hear about you? Do friends send them to your website? Do they google something? Or…?</li>
                <li>What EMOTIONS will viewers of this video associate with their problem or burning desire? These could include shame, fear, anger, jealousy of others who’ve achieved what they want to achieve, anxiety, or anything else.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(Note that I’m not looking for one-word answers like “shame,” but a SPECIFIC and DETAILED answer like “Jane is worried about how she might appear to her bosses if she tries to negotiate her salary. She’s afraid she’ll come across as overly aggressive, ungrateful, or even ‘unladylike’.”)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are all the ways your solution will make the viewer’s life better after they use it?</li>
                <li>In longer videos, sometimes there may be enough time to teach viewers something surprising, or give them some juicy tips. Readers love this!<br>
                <br>
                For example, a divorce attorney can advise viewers going through a divorce to refrain from using social media, where their words can be used against them in court. What are some surprising tips that viewers of this video might like to know about?<br>
                <br></li>
                <li>What are the most important features and benefits you’d like to highlight about your product? (Keep in mind the difference between features and benefits...for example, the octagonal shape of a pencil is a feature -- the benefit is that it won’t roll off your desk.)</li>
                <li>What are the top OBJECTIONS or frequently asked questions customers have about the solution you’re offering? What would you say to overcome each of those objections?<br>

                    <p>Your script needs to be tight… There’s zero room for fluff or filler. You need to showcase the viewer’s problem and describe a specific solution -- and you need to do it in an authentic way. The more great information you start with, the easier it’ll be to pull it off.</p>

                    <p>Family members will spend months digging for account and insurance information with mixed success, often placing stress on family relationships.</p>
